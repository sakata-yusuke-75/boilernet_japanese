       Governments and societies that bet on the market system become morematerially prosperous and technologically powerful. The lesson usually drawn from this economic success story is that in the overwhelming majority of cases the best thing the government can do for the economy is to set the background rules - define property rights, set up honest courts, perhaps rearrange the distribution of income, impose minor taxes and subsidies to compensate for well-defined and narrowly-specified "market failures" - but otherwise the government should leave the market system alone.

       The main argument for the market system is the dual role played by prices. On the one hand, prices serve to ration demand: anyone unwilling to pay the market price does not get the good. On the other hand, price serves to elicit production: any organization that can make a good, or provide a service, for less than its market price has a powerful financial incentive to do so. What is produced goes to those who value it the most. What is produced is made by the organizations that can make it the cheapest. And what is produced is whatever the ultimate users value the most.

       The data processing and data communications revolutions shake the foundations of the standard case for the market. In a world in which a large chunk of the goods valued by users are information goods that can be cheaply replicated, it is not socially optimal to charge a price to ration demand. In a world in which cheap replication produces enormous economies of scale, the producers that survive and profit are not those that can produce at the least cost or produce the goods that users value the most; instead, the producers that flourish are those that established their positions first. In a world in which the value chain is only tangentially related to ultimate value to users - in which producers earn money by selling eyeballs to advertisers, say - there is no certainty that what is produced will be what users value the most.

       The market system may well prove to be tougher than its traditional defenders have thought, and to have more subtle and powerful advantages than those that defenders of the invisible hand have usually listed. At the very least, however, defenders will need new arguments. And at the most, we will need to develop a new economics to discern new answers to the old problem of economic organization.

      You can criticize the market system because it undermines the values of community and solidarity. You can criticize the market system because it is unfair - for it gives good things to those who have control over whatever resources turn out to be most scarce as society solves its production allocation problem, not to those who have any moral right to good things. But - at least under the conditions economists have for two and one-quarter centuriesfirst implicitly, and more recently explicitly, assumed - you cannot criticizethe market system for being unproductive.

Unexpressed but implicit in Adam Smith's argument for the efficiency of the market system are assumptions about the nature of goods and services and the process of exchange, assumptions that fit reality less well today than they did in Adam Smith's day.

      Our final section does not answer all the questions we raise. We are not prophets, after all. Thus, our final section raises still more questions, for the most we can begin to do today is to organize our concerns. By looking at the behavior of people in high-tech commerce - people for whom the abstract doctrines and theories that we present have the concrete reality of determiningwhether they get paid - we can make some guesses about what the next economics and the next set of sensible policies might look like, if indeed there is going to be a genuinely new economy and, thus, a genuinely new economics. We can warn against some pitfalls in the hope that our warnings will make things better rather than worse.

      All three of these pillars fit the economy of Adam Smith's day relatively well. The prevalence of craft, as opposed to mass production, guaranteed that two goods could be made only at twice the cost of one. The fact that most goods and services were valued principally for their (scarce) physical form meant that two could not use one good: If I am using the plow to plow my field today, you cannot use it to plow yours. Thus, rivalry was built into the structure of material life that underpinned the economy of production and exchange.

      In the information-based sectors of the next economy, the owners of goods and services - call them "commodities" for short - will find that they are no longer able to easily and cheaply exclude others from using or enjoying the commodities. The carrot-and-stick principle that once enabled owners of property to extract value from those who wanted to use it was always that if you paid you got to make use of it, and if you did not pay you did not get to make use of it.

      But digital data is cheap and easy to copy. Methods do exist to make copying difficult, time-consuming and dangerous to the freedom and wealth of the copier, but these methods add expense and complexity. "Key disk" methods of copy protection for programs vanished in the late 1980s as it became clear that the burdens they imposed on legitimate purchasers and owners were annoying enough to cause buyers to "vote with their feet" for competing products. Identification-and-password restrictions on access to online information are only as powerful as users' concern for information providers' intellectual property rights, which is surely not as powerful as the information providers' concern [

      ]. The appropriate paradigm then shifts in the direction of a fundraising drive for a National Public Radio station. When commodities are not excludable, people simply help themselves. If the user feels like it, he or she may make a "pledge" to support the producer. The user sends money to the producer not because it is the only way to gain the power to use the product, but out of gratitude and for the sake of reciprocity.

      This reciprocity-driven revenue stream may well be large enough that producers cover their costs and earn a healthy profit. Reciprocity is a basic mode of human behavior. Most people do feel a moral obligation to tip cabdrivers and waiters. People do contribute to National Public Radio (NPR). But without excludability, the belief that the market economy produces the optimal quantity of any commodity is hard to justify. Other forms of provision - public support funded by taxes that are not voluntary, for example - that had fatal disadvantages vis-a-vis the competitive market when excludability reignedmay well deserve re-examination [

      We can get a glimpse of the way the absence of excludability can warp a market and an industry by taking a brief look at the history of network television. During its three-channel apogee in the 1960s and 1970s, NorthAmerican network television was available to anyone with an antenna and a receiver. Broadcasters lacked the means of preventing the public from getting the signals free of charge [

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The absence of excludability for broadcast television did not destroy the television broadcasting industry. Broadcasters couldn't charge for what they were truly producing, but broadcasters worked out that they could charge for something else: the attention of the program-watching consumers during commercials. Rather than paying money directly, the customers of the broadcast industry merely had to endure the commercials (or get up and leave the room, or channel-surf) if they wanted to see the show.

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      This "attention economy" solution prevented the market for broadcast programs from collapsing. It allowed broadcasters to charge someone for something, to charge advertisers for eyeballs rather than viewers for programs.But it left its imprint on the industry. Charging for advertising does not lead to the same

Considertwo programs, one of which will fascinate 500,000 people, and the other of which 30 million people will watch as slightly preferable to watching their ceilings. The first might well be better for social welfare. The 500,000 with a high willingness to pay might well, if there were a way to charge them, collectively outbid the 30 million apathetic couch potatoes for the use of scarce bandwidth to broadcast their preferred program. Thus, a network able to collect revenues from interested viewers would broadcast the first program, seeking the applause (and the money) of the dedicated and forgoing the eye-glazed semi-attention of the larger audience.

      But this competitive process breaks down when the network obtains revenue by selling commercials to advertisers. The network can offer advertisers either one million or 60 million eyeballs. How much the commercials will influence the viewers depends relatively little on how much they like the program. As a result, charging for advertising gives every incentive to broadcast what a mass audience will tolerate. It gives no incentive to broadcast what a niche audience would love.

      As bandwidth becomes cheaper, these problems become less important. One particular niche program may well be worth broadcasting when the mass audience has become sufficiently fragmented by the viewability of multiple clones of bland programming. Until now, however, expensive bandwidth combined with the absence of excludability meant that broadcasting revenues depended on the viewer numbers rather than the intensity of demand. Non-excludability helped ensure that broadcast programming would be "a vast wasteland" [

      In the information-based sectors of the next economy, the use or enjoyment of an information-based commodity will no longer necessarily involve rivalry. With most tangible goods, if Alice is using a particular good, Bob cannot be. Charging the ultimate consumer the good's cost of production or the free-market price provides the producer with an ample reward for its effort. It also leads to the appropriate level of production. Social surplus (measured in money) is not maximized by providing the good to anyone whose final demand for a commodity is too weak for that person to wish to pay the cost for it that a competitive market would require.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      But if goods are non-rival - if two can consume as cheaply as one - then charging a per-unit price to users artificially restricts distribution. To truly maximize social welfare, we need a system that supplies everyone whose willingness to pay for the good is greater than the marginal cost of producing another copy. If the marginal cost of reproduction of a digital good is near zero, that means almost everyone should have it for almost no charge. However, charging a price equal to marginal cost almost surely leaves the producer bankrupt, with little incentive to maintain the product except for the hope of maintenance fees. There is no incentive to make another one except that warm, fuzzy feeling one gets from impoverishing oneself for the general good.

      Thus we have a dilemma. If the price of a digital good is above the marginal cost of making an extra copy, some people who truly ought (in the best of all possible worlds) to be using it do not get to have it. The system of exchange that we have developed is getting in the way of a certain degree of economic prosperity. But if price is not above the marginal cost of making an extra copy of a non-rival good, the producer will not be paid enough to cover costs. Without non-financial incentives, all but the most masochistic producer will get out the business of production.

      More important, perhaps, is that the existence of large numbers of important and valuable goods that are non-rival casts doubt upon the value of competitionitself. Competition has been the standard way of keeping individual producers from exercising power over consumers. If you don't like the terms the producer is offering, you can just go down the street. But this use of private economicpower to check private power may come at a high cost if competitors spend their time duplicating each other's efforts and attempting to slow down technological development in the interest of obtaining a compatibility advantage, or creating a compatibility or usability disadvantage for the other competitor.

      One traditional answer to this problem (now in total disfavor) was to set up a government regulatory commission to control the "natural monopoly." The commission would set prices and would do the best it could to simulate a socially optimum level of production. On the eve of World War I, when American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), under the leadership of its visionary CEO, Theodore N. Vail, began its drive for universal coverage, a political consensus formed rapidly both in Washington and within AT&amp;T that the right structural form for the telephone industry was a privately owned, publicly regulated national monopoly.

Often this occurs because the natural career path for analysts and commissioners involves some day going to work in the regulated industry in order to leverage expertise in the regulatory process. Sometimes it is because no one outside the regulated industry has anywhere near the same financial interest in manipulating the rules, or lobbying to have them adjusted. The only effective way a regulatory agency has to gauge what is possible is to examine how other firms in other regions are doing.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Why is transparency at risk? Because much of the value added in the data-processing and data-communications industries today comes from complicatedand evolving systems of information provision. Adam Smith's pinmakers sold a good that was small, fungible, low-maintenance and easily understood. Alice could buy her pins from Gerald today and from Henry tomorrow. But today's purchaser of, say, a cable modem connection to the Internet from AT&amp;T-Excite-@Home is purchasing a bundle of present goods and future services, and is making a down payment on the establishment of a long-termrelationship with AT&amp;T-Excite-@Home. Once the relationship is established, both buyer and seller find themselves in different positions. Adam Smith's images are less persuasive in the context of services - especially services that require deep knowledge of the customer's wants and situation(and of the maker's capabilities) - that are not, by their nature, fungibleor easily comparable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      When Alice shops for a software suite, not only does she want to know about its current functionality - something notoriously difficult to figure out until one has had days or weeks of hands-on experience - but she also needs to have some idea of the likely support that the manufacturer will provide. Is it a toll call? Is the line busy at all hours? Do the operators have a clue? Will next year's corporate downsizing lead to longer holds on support calls?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Worse, what Alice really needs to know cannot be measured at all before she is committed. Learning how to use a software package is an investment she would prefer not to repeat. Since operating systems are upgraded frequently, and interoperability needs change even more often, Alice needs to have a prediction about the likely upgrade path for her suite. This, however, turns on unknowable and barely guessable factors: the health of the corporation, the creativity of the software team, the corporate relationships between the suite seller and other companies.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Some of the things Alice wants to know, such as whether the suite works and works quickly enough on her computer, are potentially measurable, at least, although one rarely finds a consumer capable of measuring them before purchase, or a marketing system designed to accommodate such a need. You buy the shrink-wrapped box at a store, take it home, unwrap the box - and find that the program is incompatible with your hardware, your operating system, or one of the six programs you bought to cure defects in the hardware or the operating system.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Worse still, the producer of a software product has every incentive to attempt to "lock in" as many customers as possible. Operating system revisions that break old software versions require upgrades. A producer has an attractive and inelastic revenue source to the extent that "lock-in" makes switching to an alternative painful. While consumers prefer the ability to comparison-shop and to switch easily to another product, producers fear this ability - and have incentives to subtly tweak their programs to make it difficult to do so [

      We have noted that the market for modern, complex products is anythingbut transparent. While one can think of services, such as medicine, that are particularly opaque to the buyer, today it is difficult to imagine a more opaque product than software. Indeed, when one considers the increasing opacity of products in the context of the growing importance of services to the economy, it suggests that transparency will become a particularly important issue in the next economy.

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Consumers' failure to acquire full information about the software they buy certainly demonstrates that acquiring the information must be expensive. In response to this cost, social institutions have begun to spring up to get around the shrink-wrap dilemma. The first was known as shareware. You download the program; if you like the program you send its author some money, and perhaps in return you get a manual, access to support and/or an upgraded version.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The benefit of try-before-you-buy is precisely that it makes the processmore transparent. The cost is that try-before-you-buy often turns out tobe try-use-and-don't-pay.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The next stage beyond shareware has been the evolution of the institutionof the

      </span>
     </i>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      This is a time-limited (or bug-ridden, or otherwiserestricted) version of the product. Users can investigate the properties of the public beta version to figure out whether the product is worthwhile. But to get the permanent (or the less bug-ridden) version, they have to pay.

      Yet a third stage is the "dual track" version: Eudora shareware versus Eudora Pro, for example. Perhaps the hope is that users of the free low-powerversion will some day become richer, or less patient or find they have greater needs. At that point, they will find it least disruptive to switch to a product that looks and feels familiar, that is compatible with their habits and with their existing files. In effect (and if the sellers are lucky), the free version captures users as future customers before they are even aware they are future buyers.

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The developing free-public-beta industry is a way of dealing with the problem of lack of transparency. It is a relatively benign development, in the sense that it involves competition through distribution of lesser versions of the ultimate product. An alternative would be (say) the strategy of constructing barriers to compatibility. The famous examples in the computerindustry come from the 1970s, when Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) made nonstandard cable connectors; from the mid-1980s, when IBM attempted to appropriate the entire PC industry through its PS/2 line; and from thelate 1980s, when Apple Computer used a partly ROM-based operating system to exclude clones.

      Fortunately for consumers, these alternative strategies proved (in the latter two cases, at least) to be catastrophic failures for the companies pursuing them.

      Open source's vulnerability (and perhaps also its strength) is that it is, by design, only minimally excludable. Without excludability, it is harder to get paid for your work. Traditional economic thinking suggests that all other things being equal, people will tend to concentrate their efforts on things that get them paid. And when, as in software markets, the chance to produce a product that dominates a single category holds out the prospect of enormous payment (think Windows), one might expect that effort to be greater still.

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Essentially volunteer software development would seem particularly vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. Open source has, however, evolved a number of strategies that at least ameliorate, and may even overcome, this problem. Open-source authors gain status by writing code. Not only do they receive kudos, but the work can be used as a way to gain marketable reputation. Writing open-source code that becomes widely used and accepted serves as a virtual business card, and helps overcome the lack of transparency in the market for high-level software engineers.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The absence of the prospect of an enormous payout may retard the development of new features in large, collaborative open-source projects. It may also reduce the richness of the feature set. However, since most people apparently use a fairly small subset of the features provided by major packages, this may not be a major problem. Furthermore, open source may make proprietary designer add-ons both technically feasible and economically rational.
     </span>
    </p>

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      In open source, the revenues cannot come from traditional intellectual property rights alone. One must provide some sort of other value - be it a help desk, easy installation, or extra features - in order to be paid. Moreover, there remains the danger that one may not be paid at all.

Now that Bargain Finder and other intelligent shopping agents have spread into a wide range of markets, a virtual war over access to and control of price information is raging in the online marketplace.

      In the initial version of Bargain Finder, and to this day, the user enters the details of a music compact disk she might like to purchase. Bargain Finderinterrogates several online music stores that might offer to sell it. It then reports back the prices in a tidy table that makes comparison shopping easy. Initially, the system was not completely transparent. It was not always possible to discern the vendor's shipping charges without visiting the vendor's Web site. But as Bargain Finder's inventors said, it was "only an experiment."

It can be further customized to take account of shipping costs by zip code, and results can be sorted by price or by speed of delivery. While the user sees the names of the firms whose prices are listed, it's a short list, and there is no way to know what other firms may have been queried.

      The claim that eBay's auction prices or the details of the sellers' offers to sell are protected in the U.S. by copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property law is bogus. (However, there are proposals in Congress to change the law in a way that may make the claim more plausible in the future.) Other hitherto untested legal theories may, however, prove more plausible. A claim that meta-sites were somehow damaging eBay by overloading its servers, or a claim based on some kind of trespass, might find more support.

      Whether meta auction sites burden certain targeted servers is itself a difficult factual issue.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      It is particularly appropriate to ask what the economically efficient solution might be at a time when the law is somewhat in flux. Most economists, be they Adam Smithian classicists, neoclassical Austrians, or more modern economics-of-information mavens, would at first thought instinctively agree with the proposition that a vendor in a competitive market selling a standardized product - for one Tiger Lily CD is as good as another - would want customers to know as much as possible about what the vendor offers for sale, and the prices at which the goods are available.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The reason for this near-consensus is that in a competitive market every sale at the offer price should be welcome; all are made at a markup overmarginal cost. Thus, all online CD retailers ought to have wanted to be listed by Bargain Finder, if only because every sale that went elsewhere when they had the lowest price was lost profit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      But not so.

    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      A significant fraction of the merchants regularly visited by Bargain Finderwere less than ecstatic. They retaliated by blocking the agent's access to their otherwise publicly available data. As of March 1997, one thirdof the merchants targeted by Bargain Finder locked out its queries. One,
     </span>
     <a href="http://www.cdnow.com">
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       CDNOW
      </span>
     </a>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      , did so for frankly competitive reasons. The other two said that the costs of large numbers of "hobbyist" queries were too great for them. A similar dynamic is currently unfolding in the online auction world: eBay, the best-known online auction site, has started to block AuctionWatch's access to eBay's data.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      One possible explanation for the divergence between the economic theorist'sprediction that every seller should want to be listed by Bargain Finder or AuctionWatch and the apparent outcome is the price-gouging story. In this scenario, stores blocking comparison sites tend to charge higher-than-normal prices because they are able to take advantage of consumer ignorance of cheaper alternatives. The stores are gouging buyers by taking advantage of relatively high search costs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Our utterly unscientific Web browsing supports the hypothesis that consumers have yet to figure out how to bring their search costs down - R-U-Sure mayneed a lot more publicity. Prices are in flux and do not appear to be behaving the way Adam Smith would predict. Random browsing among various delivery channels reveals wide price fluctuations, peaking at 40% on one occasion for consumer electronics items under $200. In this case, Bargain Finder and its successors would indeed be valuable developments. They will make markets more efficient and will lower prices.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Another possibility is the "kindly service" story. Perhaps stores blockingBargain Finder, R-U-Sure or meta-sites tend to charge higher-than-normal prices because they provide additional service or convenience. If commerce becomes increasingly electronic and impersonal (or if "personal" comes to mean "filtered through fiendishly clever software agents"), this sort of humanized attention will become increasingly expensive. To the extent that this additional service or convenience can be provided automatically, things are less clear.

      <span __boilernet_label="0" __num="224">

      ]. As consumers switched to less costly (and less carefully made, one-size-fits-all) mass-produced furniture, carvers became scarce and business for the remaining carvers became scarcer. Soon only the rich could engage their services.

      If the "kindly service" story is right, the rise of the commodity marketcreates a risk of a possible decline in service-intensive or higher-quality goods. Mass tastes will be satisfied more cheaply, yet specialty tastes will become more of an expensive luxury. On the other hand, the rise of shop-bots such as Bargain Finder or R-U-Sure offers an opportunity for consumers to aggregate their preferences on a worldwide scale. Indeed,

      provides a service by which consumers can group together to put in a group buy for a product. The larger the number of units, the lower the price, although it is not clear that even the resulting price is always lower than what might be found by determined Web browsing. Thus, the transaction costs associated with aggregation of identical but disparate preferences, and with the communication and satisfaction of individualized preferences, should be going down. As it becomes increasingly easy for consumers to communicate their individualized preferences to manufacturers and suppliers, and increasingly easy to tailor goods to individual tastes - be it a CD that has only the tracks you like, customized blue jeans, or a car manufactured (just in time) to your specifications - personalized goods may become the norm, putting the "joy" back into the economy and replacing the era of mass production with an era of mass customization.

      Some signs of this were visible even before the information revolution. Lower costs of customization have already undermined one of Scitovsky's examples as fresh-baked bread makes its comeback at many supermarkets and specialty stores. Alfred P.

      In either the "price gouging" or the "kindly service" story, the advent of services such as Bargain Finder and R-U-Sure presents retailers of many goods with a dilemma. If they join in, they contribute toward turning the market for CDs, books, consumer electronics and other, similar goods into a commodity market with competition only on price. If they act "selflessly" and stay out, in order to try to degrade the utility of shop-bots and meta-sites (and preserve their higher average markup), they must hope that their competitorswill understand their long-run self-interest in the same way.

      But overt communication in which all sellers agreed to block Bargain Finderwould, of course, violate the Sherman Act. And without a means of retaliationto "punish" players that do not pursue the collusive long-run strategy of blocking Bargain Finder, the collapse of the market into a commodity market with only price competition, and with little provided in the way of ancillary shopping services, appears likely.

      When we wrote the first draft of this paper, we noted that if CD retailers were trying to undermine Bargain Finder by staying away, their strategy appeared to be failing. Some CD retailers that initially blocked Bargain Finderlater unblocked it, while others were clamoring to join. Since then, the rise of a new generation of meta-sites and alternate means of creating price competition makes the question somewhat moot. The technological arms race, pitting meta-sites and shop-bots against merchants, will continue, but the attackers seem to have the advantage, if only because of their numbers.

      Whether or not this is an occasion for joy depends on which of our explanations above is closer to the truth. The growth of the bookstore chain put the local bookshop out of business, just as the growth of supermarkets killed the corner grocer. Not everyone considers this trend to be a victory, despite the lower prices. A human element has been lost, and a "personal service" element that may have led to a better fit between purchaser and purchase has been lost as well.

      So far, the discussion has operated on the basis of the assumption thatmerchants have an incentive to block comparison shopping services if they charge higher-than-normal prices. Strangely, some merchants may have an incentive to block it if they charge lower-than-normal prices. As we all know, merchants sometimes advertise a "loss leader," and offer to sell a particular good at an unprofitable price. Merchants do this in order to lure consumers into the store, either to try to sell them more profitable versions of the same good (leading, in the extreme case, to "bait-and-switch"), or in the hope that the consumer will spy other, more profitable, goods to round out the market basket.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      You can explain this merchant behavior in different ways, by talking about the economics of information, locational utility, myopic consumers generalizing incorrectly on the basis of a small number of real bargains or temporary monopolies caused by the consumer's presence in this store as opposed to another store far away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      It may be that merchants blocking Bargain Finder did not want consumers to be able to exploit their "loss leaders" without having to be exposed to the other goods offered simultaneously. Without this exposure, the "loss leaders" would not lure buyers to other, higher-profit, items, but would simply be losses. The merchant's ability to monopolize the consumer's attention for a period may be the essence of modern retailing; the reaction to Bargain Finderand AuctionWatch, at least, suggests that this is what merchants believe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The growing popularity of frequent-buyer and other loyalty programs also suggests that getting and keeping customer attention is important to sellers. Interestingly, this explanation works about equally well for the "kindly service" and "loss leader" explanations - the two stories that are consistent with the assumption that the CD market was relatively efficient before Bargain Finder came along.

      One can imagine stores tailoring what they present to what they presume to be the customer's desires, based on demographic information that was available about the customer even before the first purchase. Tailoring might extend beyond showcasing different wares. Taken to the logical extreme, it would include some form of price discrimination based on facts known about the customer's preferences, or on demographic information thought to be correlated with preferences. (The U.S. and other legal systems impose constraints on the extent to which stores may generalize from demographic information.

      A critical microeconomic question in all this is how consumers and manufacturer/sellers exchange information in this market. Both consumers and sellers have an interest in encouraging the exchange of information. In order to provide what the consumer wants, the sellers need to know what is desired and how badly it is wanted. Consumers need to know what is offered where, and at what price. A shop-bot may solve the consumer's problem of price, but itwill not tell him about an existing product of which he is unaware. Similarly,CDNOW may reconfigure its store to fit customer profiles, but without some external source of information about customers, this takes time and requires repeat visitors. Indeed, it requires that customers come in through the front door. All the reconfiguration in the world will not help CDNOW or eBay if customers are unaware that they would enjoy its products, or if the customers' only relationship with CDNOW is via a shop-bot or a meta-site.

      The retail outlet in the average mall can plausibly be described as a mechanism for informing consumers about product attributes.

      It may be that the "dynamic storefront" story is the Internet's substitutefor the "kindly service" story. If so, the rise of agent-based shopping may well be surprisingly destructive. It raises the possibility of a world in which retail shops providing valuable services are destroyed by an economic process that funnels a large percentage of consumer sales into what become commodity markets without middlemen. People use the high-priced premium cyberstore to browse, but then use Bargain Finder to purchase.

      To appreciate the problem, consider Bob, an online merchant who hasinvested a substantial amount in a large and easy-to-use "browsing" databasethat combines your past purchases, current news, new releases and otherinformation to present you with a series of choices and possible purchasesthat greatly increase your chances of coming across something interesting. After all, a customer enters seeking not a particular title, and not a random title, but a product that he or she would like. What is being sold is the process of search and information acquisition that leads to the judgment that this is something to buy. A good online merchant would make the service of "browsing" easy - and would in large part be selling that browsing assistance.

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Collaborative filtering provides part of the answer to the informationexchange problem. It also provides another example of how information technology changes the way that consumer markets will operate. In their simplest form, collaborative filters bring together consumers to exchange information about their preferences. The assumption is that if Alice finds that several other readers - each of whom, like her, likes Frisch, Kafka, Kundera and Klima but gets impatient with James and Joyce - tend to like William Gass, the odds are good that Alice will enjoy Gass's

    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      In the process of entering sufficient information about her tastes to prime the pump, Alice adds to the database of linked preference information. In helping herself, Alice helps others. In this simplest form, the collaborativefilter helps Alice find out about new books she might like. The technology is applicable to finding potentially desirable CDs, news, Web sites, software,travel, financial services and restaurants, as well as to helping Alice find people who share her interests.

    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The truly interesting development, however, comes when Alice's personal preference data are available to every merchant Alice visits. (Leave asidefor a moment who owns these data, and the terms on which they become available.) A shop such as CDNOW becomes able to tailor its virtual storefront to a fairly good model of Alice's likely desires upon her first visit. CDNOW may use this information to showcase its most enticing wares, or it may use it to fine-tune its prices to charge Alice all that she can afford - or both.

      Whichever is the case, shopping will not be the same.

    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Once shops acquire the ability to engage in price discrimination, consumers will of course seek ways of fighting back. One way will be to shop anonymously, and see what price is quoted when no consumer data are proffered. Consumers can either attempt to prevent merchants and others from acquiring the transactionaldata that could form the basis of a consumer profile, or they can avail themselves of anonymizing intermediaries that will protect the consumer against the merchant's attempt to practice perfect price discrimination by aggregating data about the seller's prices and practices. In this model, a significant fraction of cyber commerce will be conducted by software agents that will carry accreditation demonstrating their credit worthiness, but will not be traceable back to those who use them.

Business fliers across America routinely purchase back-to-back round-trip tickets that bracket a Saturday night in an attempt to diminish the airlines' ability to charge business travelers premium prices. Airlines, meanwhile, have invested in computer techniques to catch and invalidate the second ticket.

      Consumers will face difficult maximization problems. In the absence of price discrimination, and assuming privacy itself is only an intermediate good (i.e., that consumers do not value privacy in and of itself), the marginal value to the consumer of a given datum concerning her behavior is likely to be less than the average value to the merchant of each datum in an aggregated consumer profile. If markets are efficient, or if consumers suffer from a plausible myopia in which they value data at the short-run marginal value rather than the long-term average cost, merchants will purchase this information, leading to a world with little transactional privacy [

      Furthermore, the lost privacy is not without gain. Every time Alice visits a virtual storefront that has been customized to her preferences, her search time is reduced, and she is more likely to find what she wants - even if she didn't know she wanted it - and the more information the merchant has about her, the more true this will be.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      The picture becomes even more complicated once one begins to treat privacyitself as a legitimate consumer preference rather than as merely an intermediate good. Once one accepts that consumers may have a taste for privacy, it is no longer obvious that the transparent consumer is an efficient solution for the management of customer data. Relaxing an economic assumption does not, however, change anything about actual behavior, and the same tendencies that push the market toward a world in which consumer data is a valuable and much-traded commodity persist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Indeed, basic ideas of privacy are under assault. Data miners and consumerprofilers are able to produce detailed pictures of the tastes and habits of increasing numbers of consumers. The spread of intelligent traffic managementsystems and video security and recognition systems, and the gradual integrationof information systems built into every appliance, will eventually make it possible to track movement as well as purchases. Once one person has this information, there is, of course, almost no cost for making it availableto all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure the demand for privacy. Furthermore, the structure of the legal system does not tend to allow consumers to express this preference. Today, most consumer transactions are governed by standard-form contracts. The default rules may be constrained by state consumer law, or by portions of the Uniform Commercial Code, but they generally derivemost of their content from boilerplate language written by a merchant's lawyer. If you are buying a dishwasher, you do not get to haggle over the terms of the contract, which (in the rare case that they are even read) are found in small print somewhere on the invoice.

      Although it is possible to imagine a world in which the Internet allows for negotiation of contractual terms even in consumer sales, we have yet to hear of a single example of this phenomenon, and see little reason to expect it. On the contrary, to the extent that a trend can be discerned, it is in the other direction, toward the "Web-wrap" or "clip-wrap" contract (the neologisms derive from "shrink-wrap" contracts, in which the buyer of software is informed that she will agree to the terms by opening the wrapper), in which the consumer is asked to agree to the contract before being allowed to view the Web site's content.

      We suspect that policies that ensure diversity of providers will continue to have their place. One of the biggest benefits of a market economy is that it provides for sunset. When faced with competition, relatively inefficient organizations fail to take in revenue to cover their costs, and then they die. Competition is thus still a virtue, whether the governing framework is one of gift-exchange or buy-and-sell - unless competition destroys the ability to capture significant economies of scale.

      The challenge for policy makers is likely to be particularly acute in the face of technological attempts to recreate familiar market relationships. That markets characterized by the properties of rivalry, excludability and transparency are efficient does not mean that any effort to reintroduce these properties to a market lacking them necessarily increases social welfare. Furthermore, in some cases the new, improved, versions may provide more excludability or transparency than did the old model; this raises new problems. Holders of intellectual property rights in digital information, be they producers or sellers, do have a strong incentive to reintroduce rivalry and excludability into the market for digital information.

      It appears increasingly likely that technological advances such as "digitalwatermarks" will allow each copy of a digital data set, be it a program or a poem, to be uniquely identified.

      It is equally hard to imagine how rivalry might be re-created for digitizeddata without using an access system that relies on a hardware token of some sort or on continuing interaction between the seller and the buyer. Rivalry can be reintroduced if access to a program, a document, or other digital data can be conditioned on access to a particular "smart card" or other physical object. Or rivalry can be reintroduced by requiring the user to get permission every time the data are accessed, permitting the data provider to confirm, via IP lookup, caller ID, or some other means, that the data are being used by the credentialed user. Perhaps a cryptographically based software analog might be developed that relied on some secret that the purchaser would have a strong incentive to keep to herself. In each case, a form of rivalry results, since multiple users can be prevented from using the data simultaneously.

      But imposing rivalry where it is not naturally found means imposing a socially unnecessary cost on someone. The result may look and feel like a traditional market, but it cannot, by definition, carry the "optimality"properties markets have possessed in the past. The artificial creation of rivalry ensures that many users whose willingness to pay for a good is greater than the (near-zero) marginal cost of producing another copy will not get one.

      The consequences may be earthshaking. For about two centuries starting in 1800, technological progress was the friend of the unskilled worker. It provided a greater relative boost to the demand for workers who were relatively unskilled (who could tighten bolts on the assembly line, or move things about so that the automated production process could use them, or watch largely self-running machines and call for help when they stopped) than for those who were skilled. The spread of industrial civilization was associated with a great leveling in the distribution of income.

Economists regularly try to spawn new theories - today, evolutionary economics, the economics of organizations and bureaucracies, public choice theory and the economics of networks.

      Experience suggests that the regulations for tomorrow's economy are likely to be written today. That means policy choices will be made in advance of both theory and practice, and with disproportionate input from those who have the most to lose from change, or who have garnered short-term first-mover advantages from the first stage of the transition now under way. If we are correct in believing that some of the basic assumptions that drive most thinking about the market (and most introductory economics classes) will not hold up well in the online economy, it is particularly important for those choices to be made with care.

      10. That excludability is a very important foundationfor the market is suggested by the fact that governments felt compelled to invent it. Excludability does not exist in a Hobbesian state of nature. The laws of physics do not prohibit people from sneaking in and taking your things; the police and the judges do. Indeed, most of what we call "the rule of law" consists of a legal system that enforces excludability. Enforcement of excludability ("protection of my property rights," even when the commodity is simply sitting there unused and idle) is one of the few tasks that the theory of

It is worth noting that in the debate over Microsoft in the second half of the 1990s, virtually no one proposed a Federal Operating System Commission to regulate Microsoft as the FCC had regulated the Bell System. The dilemmas that had led to the Progressive-era proposed solutionwere stronger than ever. But there was no confidence in that solution tobe found anywhere.
