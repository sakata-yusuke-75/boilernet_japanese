              I did not change my name when I married and I can't imagine how anyone could. To me, that would be like changing my face; it's such a central part of my identity. It was never even a possibility for me.

              Plus, I can never remember any of the last names of the few friends I have who have changed their last names. I've even met a few parents who forget what their own daughter's last name is after she changes it! It' actually a bit disturbing when someone changes their name, I'm very attached to permanence. I was also surprised to find how happy it made my father when he found out I was keeping my (and his) last name.

              Most men I know seem to think that keeping my last name is admirable. However, my husband's family does not approve. They are too intimidated to say anything to me about it though, and its a good thing, because they don't want to get into an argument with me about a tradition based on women as property!!

              Also, when we have a child, it will have my last name. Both parents are generally equal, but I'm the one that has to carry the dang kid in my body for 9 months, so the balance is shifted in my favor. My husband agrees with that logic.

              I didn't change my last name when I got married, instead my husband took my last name. He didn't feel all that attached to his last name since his family is scattered, and he knew that I did feel attached to my last name, so it just seemed like the natural choice for us. But that being said, had he not been receptive to taking my name I would have taken his, or we might have came up with a different new last name for both of us. We feel stongly that we have the same name that our kids do. It just seems easier that way, and I wouldn't want anybody to mistakenly think my child was from a broken home.

              I view my name as part of my identity, and while I appreciate the "family unity" argument, I also wasn't comfortable with changing my name just because I got married.

              My mother (married in 1969 and a feminist) took Dad's name, and she said it was easier to change her name and it was a man's name anyways. For me, it's not about it being a man's name, it's about the name I was born with, got used to, practice under and associate myself with. And it also seems a little unfair that the default is that the woman changes her name. If both change to a new name, that seems much more equitable.

              Unlike some women who kept their names, I have no qualms about being called by my husband's last name, and I occasionally offer that name in social settings for convenience purposes. We get mail with all sorts of combinations of our last names. I do not care what other people call me, I am not bothered in the least to be called by his name -- I simply did not want to change my name professionally or with my friends and family.

              Children pose a problem. There is a family unity issue there (of course, I am no less my husband's wife if I do not share his name, so I am no less my child's mother if I do not share her name), but there's also a convenience issue - you'll have to take extra steps to prove that you're the spouse or mother if your name isn't the same. Therefore, if we have children, we'll review my decision, and perhaps even choose a new last name for all of us.

They also can't spell my first name accurately. The thought of spending the rest of my life going:

              I have been married for just over two years. I had never considered changing my name. I like my last name; I identify with my father; I'm an only child, and I wanted to keep the name around at least one more generation.

              Well, I'm not the party to the marriage whom you addressed, but I took my wife's last name. I'm happy to read Jana's note above, as this is the closest I've come to meeting anybody else who's done the same. Why did we do it? We were set on having the same name in order to signal our attachment and make things less confusing for our children and those who encounter them. We seriously considered inventing a new name, especially as a combination of our names, but none of the possible combinations proved very attractive. In the end, she was more attached to her name and family than I was to mine, and her name was also more aesthetically interesting.

              I kept my family name because I consider it part of "who I am." I got married when I was 30, but I would have kept the name even in my 20s, before I started on the career path. I like the sound of it, and had I taken the mate's name, I would have converted my own into something bovine: Donna Bell. Ugh.

              I think this has worked out well, and I certainly have no regrets about my or my kids' names. Sometimes I have to take a little extra time to explain to people that we all have different but related last names (like when we make airline reservations), but the only time it bothers me is when I have to have the discussion (over and over)with my own friends, especially those who've known me long before I got married.

              I married eight years ago and kept my last name. Our kids have Paul's last name, and contrary to warnings, this has not proved too complicated. We live in a complicated world of blended families where not everyone has the same last name, so I think the world is used to some texture. I felt strongly about keeping my name at the time, but over time I can barely remember why. My daughter (aged 6) wants to change her last name to my last name. I guess if she wants to when she's older, I don't care, although I think her father might!

              My husband and I married in 1974. I was 23. I'd never considered any option other than keeping my own name. At the same time, I've always understood and felt comfortable with the knowledge that I am "Mrs. Husband's Name." Our children, 26 and 21, have hyphenated names, with their dad's name first. That way, in case they ever opted to drop my part of their last name, they'd already be alphabetized just fine.

              When I was in high school, we had an exchange student from Chile: Adolfo Henriquez y Chacon (a man who has gone on to become a brilliant petroleum engineer). He spent much of his year in that little small town in Indiana explaining his last name to some rather unworldly Hoosier kids. His explanation seemed obvious to me, and it's the pattern I chose to adopt for my children.

              There is an advantage to having kept my own name that I never anticipated: It turns out that my Polish DP husband has done quite well in his area of the law. With my own name, I can "fly under the radar." And, when I opt to let people know the connection, I just add "Mrs. Husband's Name" after my name.

              I married eight years ago at the age of 36 and never seriously considered changing my name. Well, that's not entirely accurate: I'd have considered hyphenating if my husband had wanted to do that (and I'd only have considered it if we BOTH hyphenated). As it happens, though, the combination of our names wasn't terribly euphonious and neither of us was too keen on making the change.

              Different last names are fairly common in our social circle (we live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, in New York City) and the convention we used for our son's name (Firstname Middlename Mylastname Hislastname, with no hyphen) is also fairly common. Between the different last names and the mutually agreed upon hyphenations, I think that couples in which she took his name might even be in the minority.

              I am entirely in agreement with Eugene's reaction to the idea of name changing: my answer to 'why did you keep your name?' would probably have to be 'why on earth would I change it?' The minor inconvenience of having to introduce myself these days as "Iris Engelson, xxxx yyyy's Mom" when calling schools, pediatricians or parents of my son's friends hardly seems a compelling reason to jettison the name I have used all my life.

              I changed my name several years before I met my husband because I wanted something easy to spell and pronounce. I wasn't likely to change it again (although contrary to what other posters have said, it wasn't that much work in the first place -- in fact it was surprisingly simple).

              I also wasn't likely to take his name because I always thought that was really silly, particularly in the context of a traditional wedding. The bride shows up wearing a hat that makes her look like an alien landed on her head with a veil covering her face (and therefore masking her identity). Carol Springer marries David Anderson, and at the end the officiator introduces "Mr. and Mrs. David Anderson." Where did Carol Springer go? The whole ceremony seems designed to strip the bride of her entire identity through the costumes and the name change -- clearly a reflection of the historical view of women as property. Not my style.

              I do resent when people call my by my husband's name. I find it irksome that they are so presumptuous as to assume that I am subservient to him, and so 1950s that they still apply this default. I recently checked my info on Lexis and found that although the title to our home, and the mortgage for it, are both listed in both of our names, the Lexis database shows me with his last name. Who on earth thought it was their business to give me an entirely new name? Makes me crazy.

              Our daughter has my last name. We never considered any other option. It would have been the same if she'd been a son. My husband's parents would have been apoplectic over this if they hadn't been so relieved to finally have a grandchild. Given how unlikely this was to happen at all, they would have been delighted if we'd named her Baby Doe.

              We've never had problems being treated as a family, even though we have different last names, and no one has ever assumed (out loud anyway) that our daughter is not legitimate. This may come from us being older parents (late 30s when she was born) and having been married for many years before her arrival.

We did consider both taking a new surname, and even had a name that we agreed on, but he felt it would be too expensive to do a name change that his home country would accept, so we both kept our names. Our son's name is hyphenated; we find that the hypenated last name is no big deal, certainly not nearly as much trouble as the boy's having four middle names (traditional in father's home country)!

              I am getting married in September and I intend to change my last name to my husband's name. I am a practicing attorney and I think the name change will initially be impractical for my colleagues, but I suppose that's just life. I considered not changing my name, but in the end it was important to me to be his wife not just his best friend and partner. In my mind, assuming the same last name is a symbol of a couple's unity that goes beyond their partnership and commitment. I don't feel as though I am becoming a member of his family as much as he and I are becoming our own family. Sharing a name is a strong symbol of the indisolubility of our marriage. Concededly, the same end would have been achieved by him taking my name, but I simply prefer his name.

              I'm married to a Japanese woman. My father-in-law changed his name to my mother-in-law's name, because she had no brothers, while he had brothers. By changing his name, he could continue the family line of his wife, my mother-in-law. This is fairly common in Japan, at least in rural areas.

              My wife changed her name to mine. Having a non-Japanese name presents some hassles for her, but having a name different from her husband would present another set of hassles. The Japanese wife of a UK friend of mine stuck with her maiden name for a few years, but gave in when they had children. The Japanese wife of a US friend uses her maiden name as a sort of professional name, but her legal name is her husband's.

              I am about-to-be-50, and got married at age 34. I kept my name for several reasons: professional license (law), attachment to my family, preservation of my family name, and a husband who couldn't understand why I'd consider changing it. In spite of all-but-the-last factor, I would have considered having us both change to a new name, but my husband had no intention of changing his name.

              When our first daughter was born, the hospital made him sign a form saying something to the effect of "I know it'll be a hassle if we change our minds later about the baby's last name". He was outraged that they would treat the use of the mother's name so differently from the more usual use of the father's name.

              Any children we have will bear his name. Not so much because he's the male, but because he's the only son of an only son, whereas I have a brother who's children will likely carry my family name. Besides, his name is much rarer than mine to begin with and it'd be a shame for it to disappear.

              I mentioned above that I'd changed my name to my wife's name. One additional thought: it has been harder for me to change my name legally than it would've been for my wife. I still have one credit card with my "maiden" name on it (anybody have a good term for that?) because the out-of-state bank (Chase) will not accept a Michigan marriage license as proof of a name change even though Michigan explicitly permits names to be changed either way (or hyphenation, etc.) with no further documentation. Interestingly, Citibank had no problem with it. Perhaps I should add that I've been carrying this non-id-matching card for almost ten years now, as our tenth anniversary is next month. Every once in a while I try to change it.
