     Blueberries are a popular early summer small fruit. Successful blueberry marketing requires that thefruit not only be of very high quality but that it also be properly packaged and thoroughly cooled.This publication explains the postharvest handling procedures necessary to deliver North Carolinablueberries of the highest quality.

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Most consumers purchase fresh blue-berries on impulse and are prompted primarily by the perception of quality.Wholesale buyers also associate appearance and firmness with fruit quality and freshness. Successful blueberrymarketing thus requires that the fruit be of the highest quality and appearance. However, blueberries are extremelyperishable and easily damaged by rough handling and adverse temperatures. Because blue-berries are often harvestedand handled during hot, humid weather, attention to proper postharvest handling is essential to maintaining quality.

    Read) are grownin North Carolina. More than 90 percent of the blueberries produced commercially are of the highbush type. Harvestingof highbush blueberries begins in late May and often continues through late June. Rabbiteye varieties ripen in lateJune, and harvesting continues into August. Blueberries, even those growing on the same bush, do not all ripen at thesame time. Under normal growing conditions, blueberries ripen over a period of three to four weeks. Ripe blueberriesshould have a completely uniform blue color. Fruit with a red tinge are less mature and will not be as sweet as moremature berries even though they ship well and will turn completely blue within several days. Depending upon the cropand the weather conditions, blueberry fields may be harvested as many as four times in intervals of five to seven days. For rabbiteye varieties the interval between harvests may be as long as nine daysin cool dry weather. Harvesting more frequently may not make efficient use of labor, whereas less frequent harvestingmay result in a high percentage of overripe fruit.
   </span>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In general, high temperatures during blueberry harvest season promote ripening. Heavy rains during periods of hightemperature can further hasten ripening, cause splitting, and greatly reduce storage quality. When picking labor islimited, prime fruit may easily become overripe. Overripe blueberries are extremely easy to damage. Blueberries that don t look too bad when picked may be totally unacceptable when they reach the consumer. Be careful! Price, andparticularly reputations, depend largely on quality. Once damaged, your reputation and that of your marketingorganization may be very difficult to repair. Consumers long remember experiences with a poor quality product.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Whenever possible, avoid harvesting wet blueberries. Wet berries are very susceptible to decay organisms and oftenresemble overripe berries leaking juice. Waiting a few hours to begin harvesting after a rain or heavy dew cansignificantly reduce the chance of infection by postharvest disease organisms and can improve the appearance of thefruit.

     Manual Harvesting
    </span>
   </h3>
   <span __boilernet_label="1">
    Proper instruction and careful supervision of the picking crew is essential to the success of any harvestingoperation. Postharvest quality control begins in the field. Packing house problems and buyer complaints are often theresult of poorly trained and supervised pickers. Have a responsible person supervise the pickers at all times. If thefruit is harvested directly into pint cups, it is a good idea to check one or two pints at random in each flat. Thischeck can be made easily by emptying the contents of a pint cup into a shallow pan where each berry can be examinedindividually. Finding more than 6 to 8 percent poor-quality fruit per pint indicates a need for greater qualitycontrol.
   </span>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Ripe blueberries are easily removed from the bush. Fruit should be removed with the thumb and forefinger, keepingthe hand cupped under the berry to avoid dropping it. The whitish, dusty appearance (bloom) of the blueberry is highlydesirable, and consumers regard it as a sign of quality. Overhandling the berries will remove the bloom. In addition,all workers should be reminded that they are handling a food product that is eaten fresh and often not washed. Cleanhands and sanitary personal habits are required at all times.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Harvested blueberries should never be allowed to remain in the sun. The dark berries will readily absorb heat. Ifberries are picked into buckets, the buckets should be no larger than 5 quarts and of rigid construction to minimizemashing and the accumulation of respiration heat.

     Mechanical Harvesting
    </span>
   </h3>
   <span __boilernet_label="1">
    Recurring labor problems have prompted some blueberry growers to investigate mechanical harvesting. The majoradvantage is a significant reduction in management and labor costs. Savings in labor costs of 30 to 45 percent have beenreported. One mechanical harvester can replace as many as 100 manual pickers. Over-the-row mechanical blueberry harvesters havebeen available since the mid-sixties. These machines have been primarily of the shake-and-catch design, which detachthe blueberries by shaking or vibrating the bush. The fruit drops onto a capturing device and conveyor, on which it ismoved past an air-blast cleaner and finally into field lugs.
   </span>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Even if carefully adjusted and operated, mechanical harvesters will harvest a significant amount of unacceptablefruit. These machines have no means of detecting quality and will harvest immature, overripe, diseased, and damagedfruit that would ordinarily be discarded by a human picker. The elimination of this unacceptable fruit and foreignmatter is difficult and expensive, and it requires that the berries be handled excessively. A mechanical harvesterand the required sorting machines often subject the fruit to excessive damage. Overripe fruit, in particular, is easilydamaged by these machines. Any additional handling adversely affects the shelf life and quality of the blueberries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Although a significant percentage of the blue-berries grown worldwide are harvested by machine, most NorthCarolina growers strive to produce fruit for the higher-valued fresh market. Mechanically harvest-ed blueberries aregenerally considered unfit for the fresh market and are therefore usually frozen for processing.

     Sorting and Packing
    </span>
   </h2>
   <span __boilernet_label="1">
    Sorting harvested blueberries intended for the fresh market is time consuming, expensive, and damaging to thefruit. Therefore, this practice is generally not recommended. The best time to remove defective berries is duringmanual harvesting, thus minimizing handling. For machine-harvested blueberries, there may be no alternative but toremove trash and defects on a grading line. When a grading line must be used, it should be operated in such a way as tominimize mechanical damage.
   </span>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Whether blueberries are mechanically or manually harvested, every effort should be made to keep the percentage ofdefective fruit to an absolute minimum. Seriously defective fruit may include those with insect damage, broken skin,decay or mold, attached stems, fruit remaining in clusters, and fruit that is overripe, underripe, shriveled, or off-color. U.S. Number 1 is the only specified grade for harvested blueberries. Blueberries grading U.S. Number 1 may haveno more than 1 percent serious defects and no more than 13 percent total defects. However, in practice and especiallywith fresh-market blueberries buyers may require less than 5 percent total defective fruit.
    </span>

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Most buyers prefer large fruit over small fruit if they are of good quality. The U.S. Number 1 grade specifies thatthe count of berries per 1/2-pint container must not exceed 250. Within the U.S. Number 1 classification there are foursize classifications, as listed in Table 1.

     Almost all North Carolina fresh-market blueberries are marketed in cellophane-covered pint containers shippedin 12-pint master containers known as flats. Flats may be conveniently stacked, six to a layer, on a standard 40-by-48-inch shipping pallet (Figure 1). A pallet of blueberries customarily consists of 96 flats (1,152 pints) with a grossweight of approximately 1,200 pounds.

    (graymold). In situations where blueberries are wet and the risk of decay is high, a rinse in chlorinated water (75 to 125ppm available chlorine) has been successful in controlling these diseases. However, chlorination is a preventivemeasure only. It will not salvage fruit already infected because it cannot kill microorganisms that are already belowthe surface. Moreover, chlorination cannot be used for fresh-market fruit because the chlorine completely removes thebloom and bleaches the fruit.
   </span>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Decay organisms are very active when the fruit is warm but become much less active at lower temperatures. Warm,overripe blueberries, leaking juice from rough handling, provide an ideal site for various postharvest decays. Shelf-life experiments with packaged blueberries have demonstrated the dramatic reductions in decay possible with rapid andthorough cooling. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of cooling in reducing decay.

     Harvested blueberries should be cooled as soon as possible but always within 4 hours of harvest, if possible. Thismay require more than one pickup or trip to the cooling facility during a day of harvesting. However, the increase inshelf life and overall quality will make it worthwhile. No fruit, particularly well-ripened fruit, should ever be heldall day without cooling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Blueberries remain alive after harvest, respiring and producing heat. At a temperature of 80 F, blueberries canproduce as much as 22,000 Btu per ton per day from the heat of respiration. Unless this heat is removed by cooling, itcan cause a rise in temperature of as much as 6 F. Cooling lowers the respiration rate, slowing the ripening processand the accompanying inevitable decline in quality. The respiration rate of blueberries at 80 F is nearly 20 times therate at 40 F. In other words, blueberries held at 40 F have nearly 20 times the shelf life of those held at 80 F. Softeningis the most visible physiological damage resulting from overripening.

     Most North Carolina blueberries in wholesale channels receive some cooling. However, a portion may continue toreach the consumer in poor condition as a result of insufficient cooling. Often the effectiveness of cooling, not itsavailability, is the deciding factor in quality. Cooling must be thoroughly and consistently applied to be effective.The optimum temperature that will ensure the longest shelf life is just above freezing: 33 or 34 F.
    </span>

   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     A pallet of packaged blueberries, initially at 80 F, allowed to remain for an hour or so in a cooler without forcedventilation may appear to have cooled somewhat. However, only the blueberries on the outside will cool appreciablyin that length of time. Temperature measurements taken inside cellophane-wrapped cups near the center of palletsstanding in still air at 44 F have actually shown a slight temperature increase during the first hour of cooling.Calculations suggest that the center cups of pallets of 80 F blueberries would require more than 36 hours to cool tobelow 50 F. Pallets of hot blueberries allowed to stand in a cooler for several hours before shipment without forcedventilation will not be cooled significantly nor uniformly. Furthermore, numerous tests have shown that refrigeratedtransports provide little or no additional cooling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In still air, the average cooling rate of pallets of blueberries is slow because heat is transferred from theinterior only by conduction. The cellophane wrappers, the fiber cups, the paperboard flats, and especially the airgaps between the cups act as effective insulation, slowing the movement of heat. This fact has prompted shippers ofmany commodities to install equipment inside the cooler to force the cold air through the containers, greatly increasing the cooling rate. In existing refrigerated rooms not equippedwith fans, the addition of fans (Figure 3) to move the air is the single most cost-effective change possible, providedthat the refrigeration system has sufficient capacity to remove heat rapidly.

     Blueberries cooled with forced air reach the desired storage temperature significantly faster than those in stillair. In addition, they cool more uniformly. Figure 4 shows typical average pulp temperatures for a pallet ofblueberries in still air and for a pallet in forced air. Forced-air cooling is clearly much more rapid than cooling instill air. Depending on the circumstances, the rate of cooling may be 16 to 20 times faster.

    Although blueberries are grown commercially in about a dozen states, the major supply areas are Michigan, NewJersey, North Carolina, and the Pacific Northwest states. Over the last decade, domestic per capita consumption ofblueberries has continued to expand at an average annual rate of 4 percent. In 1991, consumption of fresh blueberriesreached 1/4 pound per person; consumption of processing blueberries (in canned and frozen form) was nearly 1/2 poundper person.

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Domestic blueberry supplies are most readily available during June, July, and August, with July being the peakharvest month. In the past, North Carolina producers have enjoyed a timely marketing advantage because they oftenharvest their berries in mid-May and June, earlier than many other competitive supply regions. Recently, however,increased plantings of highbush varieties in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas have intensified early-seasonmarketing pressures. In addition, more plentiful late-summer low-bush supplies are available from Canada.

     Local grower prices for blueberries have varied considerably over the past decade, with sharp price declinesobserved in 1985 and 1990. As the supply of high-quality berries continues to increase, local growers should continuetheir efforts to provide high-quality, properly cooled blueberries to buyers in order to maintain and expand theirmarket share.
