       in New York on May 17. I plan to talk a little bit about formats that aren't RSS and what they're good for, since it seems everyone has mastered the technology of RSS at this time. I'll happily answer questions, of course.

       , how everything is flipped around, and why the level-playing-field of RSS shouldn't be overlooked, or else it'll surprise you later. Sure it can deliver more click-throughs, but it also gives a podium to the sources of journalism, routing around the former ink-barrel purchasters.

       Anyway, since one of the hot topics is advertising and sponsorship, and since the conference isn't paying me a fee, or even covering my expenses, I thought I'd offer sponsorship opportunities to people or companies who would like to be talked about, briefly, from my speaking space. I can't guarantee what I'll say about you or your company, but I do promise to mention you, and will thank you for picking up my expenses for the New York trip.

       I also do this to demonstrate that I am not utopian, that I can be a crass commercial whore with the best of them. However, because of who I am, I must be open about it. Which will prove even more lucrative for my sponsor because they'll be out in the open too.

       How the writers get paid is a problem you created not me. It's not up to me to solve it Jason, that's your job. This is part of what I was saying today about media guys arriving, camping out, and then trying to get us to help them pay for their supposed business model. Go to Congress, see if they'll pass a law requiring us to pay a tax so you can stay in business. Or better yet, think more creatively.

       Most of the feeds I read today don't have ads, so it's hard to see how the train has left the station. I have a ticket, there's an over-supply of feeds, and when I link to one of their stories I send thousands of people to their sites, so I think they should be competing for my attention, not making me think twice about continuing to subscribe.

       I could easily unsub from Engadget. It's most definitely not a must-have feed for me. The only other of your feeds I'm subscribed to is your personal weblog. I don't think you've created nearly as much value as you think you have. Chasing a guy like me away now isn't good business, or so it seems to me.

       BTW, what exactly is wrong with the way the BBC and NY Times do it? They write good one or two sentence summaries and link to the full story from the feed, and the ad is there, not in the feed. Jason, think about it -- RSS

       Also the analogies to 1994 are pretty self-serving, don't you think? Maybe this is 2005 and it's acxtually different from any years that's come before? I tend to think it is. Maybe I'm wrong, but maybe I'm not.

       Advertising in RSS is just starting now, for all practical purposes. If we wanted to, as an industry, reject the idea, we could, by asking the people who create the software to add a feature that strips out all ads. Make it default to on. Then, that would force the advertisers, if they want to speak to us, to do so respectfully, by our choice. Create feeds of commercial information that we might be interested in, and if we are, we'll subscribe. If not, we won't.

       Too often we forget to think in our own interest, and only remember the interest of the content developers. Well, this time around we're developing the content too. We didn't need them to create the medium, they're only recent arrivals. The usual RIAA whining about there being no incentive to create doesn't apply here, because we don't have an RIAA here. But let these ads gain a footing then they'll start complaining about their right to make a living off us. Better to shut the door right away before they get in?

       If there isn't any money for them to make, so be it. Or let them find a respectful way to make it. This is the most sensible time to act, and it could be done relatively easily. Your opinions are welcome of course.

      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       In 1999, when weblogs were still pretty new, but not so new that you could visit them all in an afternoon, it became useful to have a way to find out which blogs had updated recently. So I wrote a tool that would check the weblogs and when one updated, it would add it to a list of recently updated blogs.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Eventually there were so many blogs that we couldn't check them, we had to ask them to tell us when they updated, that's when the "pinging" started. Now the pinging process records not only the address of the weblog, but if it's provided, the address of the RSS feed for the weblog.

       It depends on who you are. If you're the developer of a weblog tool, you might adapt your tool to call the "extended" ping handler, since it provides more information to weblogs.com. If you're a user of a weblog tool, you might check with your vendor to see if your tool supports it, and if so, how you can activate it. If you have any questions, please post them here as a comment. Thanks!

        "Hi, I've recently been in a major battle over the inclusion of RSS feeds in websites. This is not ordinarily a problem, but the site in question (LiveJournal) has millions of users with different interests and only one codebase. The problem is that most users don't object to syndication and aggregation, but some do object to syndication.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        "After much discussion, we've settled on (offering the option of) syndicating only headlines for these users. This seems unsatisfactory because they don't mind people reading the content in their personal aggregators, but they do mind it being reproduced on other websites and web-based aggregation services. A better solution would be to offer a "no syndication" element of some sort. My personal idea is to add an (optional, one or more may be present) "pragma" tag to handle cases like this, similar to HTML meta tags and HTTP pragma headers.

       Tech companies must understand their place isn't to guide the rest of us, rather to learn what we want and then make systems that help us do that. That's when the tech industry is making a contribution. When it tries to lead, it ends up trying to control, and that never works.

       But it only works when all components are engaged. Software developers have a role to play, but users must dominate if it's going to have a chance of working. To the extent that RSS is working it's because the users are driving the growth.

       of this interview with Tim Bray, one of the eleven designers of XML. Asked why there is no version 27.5 of XML, he gives a common sense answer, that XML is frozen, and isn't going to change. Of course, it couldn't be any other way. He says:

     <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        "XML was frozen and published in February 1998. As it came toward the end and it became obvious -- well, not obvious, but likely anyhow -- that this was going to get a lot of momentum, we were besieged by requests for extra features of one kind or another. We basically lied and told the world, we would do all that stuff in version 2. You have to shoot the engineers and ship at some point, right? I think there will never be an XML version 2. There is an XML version 1.1, but it’s controversial and not widely supported."

     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       If XML weren't frozen, it wouldn't have been possible to build XML-RPC, RSS, SOAP or OPML on top of it.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       You could still add features to XML if there was a strong enough will in the community to do so. But there doesn't seem to be any movement in that direction, and that's okay, because while XML is not perfect, it certainly is good enough. Emphatically, that XML is frozen is a

      <i>

      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       If it were a moving target nothing would get done. And the same is true of RSS.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Today, there's no question that RSS is frozen, done, settled. Yes there are still a small number of people who would like to argue about it, but the deployment speaks so much more strongly. Every time you see so-and-so "supports RSS" on

       , that's an affirmation of the power of a frozen format, and if that goes on long enough, one can justifiably start calling it a standard. With RSS that day is coming soon.
