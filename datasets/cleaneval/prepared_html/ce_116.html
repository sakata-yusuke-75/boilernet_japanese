        The corvée system caused much hardship at times. Being late for work or trying to leave early was a severe offense. Laws concerning desertion called for six months' imprisonment, forced labour or a fine. The imprisonment at Thebes of a woman for leaving her district in order not to do her corvée service is mentioned in a Middle Kingdom papyrus now at the Brooklyn Museum. But special circumstances, like illness in the family, were often taken into consideration.

        Workers were generally drafted during the time of inundation, when work in the fields was impossible. Much of the work done was in their direct interest such as the repair of dams and irrigation canals, and vicariously, the building of temples as places where the gods were worshipped by priests in their name and holidays were celebrated or the erection of pyramids, tombs and palaces for the pharaohs.

They worked in gangs of a hundred thousand men, each gang for three months. For ten years the people wore themselves out building the road over which the stones were dragged, work which was in my opinion not much lighter at all than the building of the pyramid
