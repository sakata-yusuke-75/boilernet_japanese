        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         For the first month of the second Persian Gulf war, it seemed as if Western Pennsylvania would be spared. Then the phone call came to the family of Donald Oaks Jr. in Harborcreek, an Erie suburb.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         An errant bomb, dropped by a coalition airplane, had taken the region's first casualty of war. Oaks was 20.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Erie buried its son with flourishes worthy of a hero. A downtown theater served as the venue for the funeral. Hundreds thronged into Wintergreen Gorge Cemetery, a rolling expanse of trees, gardens and greenery.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The cemetery now is covered with the snow that blows off the Great Lakes every winter. In December, it was the kind of snow in which Donald Oaks Jr. used to look for the tracks of deer.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         "He really enjoyed it," said his grandfather, Sam Oaks. "He was here in December and he went out. Even if it was only one day." Young Oaks' hunting rifle now rests unused. He left his military insurance policy to his younger sister; he'd always promised to look out after her, his grandfather said.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The family recently met with someone from the Army about the circumstances in which the young man died. Even in the face of endless news accounts detailing the accidental bombing that killed Oaks and two other soldiers, the Army held off making any official confirmation.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Earlier this month, a letter arrived, stating the Army was ready to discuss its final report on the young soldier's death, which happened "as a result of the tragic accident which took place."
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         "If you read between the lines, it tells you without seeing the report," Sam Oaks said.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Oaks died just as the family of Army Pfc. Jessica Lynch was jetting to an air base in Europe to reunite with their daughter, the lone survivor of an enemy ambush during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Other families in the region were reuniting around caskets.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         One day after Oaks was killed, Army Capt. Tristan N. Aitken, 31, born in Erie and raised in State College, was killed in action. The next day, Army Staff Sgt. Stevon A. Booker, 34, of Apollo, Armstrong County, fell in action in Baghdad.
        </span>

       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The list stretched on, even after President Bush declared the combat phase largely completed. From May through this month, more men and women would die in the occupation than in the initial invasion.
