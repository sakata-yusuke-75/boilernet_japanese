Rather, it is covered with a thin GaNlayer consisting of GaN single crystals. This is the first step of GaNcrystallization at high N </span> <sub> <span __num="102" __label="true"> 2 </span> </sub> <span __num="103" __label="true"> pressure. The size of the crystalscovering the Ga depends on the sequence and rates of compression and heating ofthe system. A typical structure of the surface layer is shown in </span> <a href="#figure5"> <span __num="104" __label="true"> Figure 5 </span> </a> <span __num="105" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
   <p> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="106" __label="true"> The formation of the surface layer inhibits further synthesis of the nitridewhich allows longtime crystallization processes and the growth of relativelylarge GaN crystals. Since the solution is in a temperature gradient, the GaNlayer at the hot end of the crucible dissolves in gallium and is transported,by convection and diffusion, to the cooler zone of the crucible where thesolution become supersaturated and crystallization of GaN takes place. Thecrystals of the surface layer are the natural source of growth centers forfurther crystallization. Some of them start to grow faster hindering the growthof the neighboring ones. This selection leads to the formation of relativelylarge, well shaped GaN crystals on the internal surface of the surface layer. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="107" __label="true"> The GaN crystals grown by this method are wurzite, mainly in the form ofhexagonal platelets or hexagonal needles, depending on the growth conditions. Ageneral tendency is that high supersaturation favors growth in the c-directionwhich produces the needle-like crystals. Supersaturation of the growth solutionis determined mainly by the growth temperature, supercooling, mass transportmechanisms in Ga, and also the local surroundings for a particular crystal. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="108" __label="true"> Crystals in the form of hexagonal platelets grow slowly, with a rate &lt;0.1mm/h into the {10 </span> <img alt="(-1)" height="16" src="/gifs/onebar.GIF" width="10"> <span __num="109" __label="true"> 0} directions (perpendicular to the c-axis). They areusually single crystals having perfect morphology suggesting stable layer-bylayer growth. They are transparent, colorless, with flat faces. In some cases,three dimensional, hexagonal growth which occurs during the post-growth systemcooling is observed on the crystal surfaces. Some GaN platelets grown withoutintentional seeding are shown in </span> <a href="#figure6"> <span __num="110" __label="true"> Figure 6 </span> </a> <span __num="111" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="112" __label="true"> For crystallization of large GaN crystals by this method, it is crucial tocontrol the supersaturation to avoid acceleration of the growth near the edgesand corners of the growing crystal. This can occur if some of them reachdimensions significantly larger than the others. Then the edge nucleation onthe hexagonal faces of the GaN platelets is often observed. This is the firststep to unstable growth on these faces. The result of such a growth is shown in </span> <a href="#figure7a"> <span __num="113" __label="true"> Figure 7a </span> </a> <span __num="114" __label="true"> . In extreme cases of very high supersaturation or when thesupersaturation is abruptly increased (i.e. by increasing the temperaturegradient), the growth into c-direction, nucleated at the edges of the platelet,become very fast and leads to the formation of well developed {10 </span> <img alt="(-1)" height="16" src="/gifs/onebar.GIF" width="10"> <span __num="115" __label="true"> 0}faces. This results in a hollow needle-like crystal such as is shown in Figure7b. Therefore, for growing of large GaN platelets of stable morphology, thesupersaturation must be decreased during the crystallization process inorder toprevent the runaway phenomena just described. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="116" __label="true"> Therefore for the stable growth of large GaN crystals it is necessary to havesufficiently low and uniform supersaturation across the growing crystal faces.One of the most important factors influencing the uniformity of N-concentrationin the growth zone is the volume of the solution in relation to the size of thegrowing crystal. In </span> <a href="#figure8"> <span __num="117" __label="true"> Figure 8 </span> </a> <span __num="118" __label="true"> we show a crystal grown in a crucible with aninternal diameter of 17 mm (as opposed to 14 mm previously). The increase inthe crucible volume resulted in a significant increase of the size of crystalswhich could be grown with stable morphology. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="119" __label="true"> We summarize the general tendencies of GaN crystal growth without anintentional seeding following from the experimental results: </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="239" __label="true"> High quality GaN crystals can be grown at nitrogen pressure up to 15kbar. The main obstacle to growing larger substrate sized GaN crystals isinstability of the growth. The instability is related to the non-uniformdistribution of nitrogen in the solution due to the small volume of thecrucible in relation to the size of growing GaN crystals. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="240" __label="true"> It is shown that high quality homoepitaxial layers can be obtained on the "asgrown", single crystalline, pressure grown GaN substrates. Further optimizationof both substrate and homoepitaxial growth techniques should lead to thefabrication of efficient optoelectronic devices. Special effort has to be paidto increasing of the size of high quality GaN substrates. </span> </p>
