These conventions must also be followed in your assessed essays, which you should use, </span> <i> <span __num="25" __label="true"> inter alia </span> </i> <span __num="26" __label="true"> , to practise presentational skills. Presentation and accuracy are important for more than stylistic reasons. Examiners will be concerned to scrutinise text layout, notes and bibliography in order to form an impression of your research technique. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> This cannot be a comprehensive guide. If you identify omissions or areas which need clarification, please report them to Robert Bickers so that they may be incorporated into later versions of this booklet. Your comments and suggestions will be very much appreciated. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="28" __label="true"> It is important to note that there is no universally accepted series of conventions. Most British academic presses (for example Oxford University Press (OUP), </span> <a href="http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk/information/authors/"> <span __num="29" __label="true"> Cambridge University Press </span> </a> <span __num="30" __label="true"> (CUP) and Blackwell) have their own idiosyncratic rules which cannot always be reconciled (and which they do not always manage to follow consistently from book to book). North American presses are generally more consistent in their conventions, but their annotation tends to be elaborate by British standards: for example, it is necessary to give the publisher of a book as well as the place of publication, and the authors' first names are given in full. So it is best not to follow American usage simply because it increases the amount of information which needs to be recorded and checked. Among the British presses, Blackwell stands out for the clarity and consistency of its annotation system. The recommendations below are substantially based on its practice. The point to emphasise is that you have some latitude in the choice of conventions: </span> <u> <span __num="31" __label="true"> internal consistency </span> </u> <span __num="32" __label="true"> within the dissertation is what matters above all else. </span> </p> <h3> <span __num="33"> Contents: </span> <a id="contents" name="contents"> </a> </h3>

It sometimes happens that there are slightly different versions of the title in various parts of the book. Disregard the dust-jacket (if there is one, of course) and go by the internal title page. This is not the very first page, which usually has just the title on it, but the page which is overleaf. (It will usually have the author's name and the name of the press on it as well.) Follow what this title page says; the only addition which need be made routinely is supplying a colon to separate the title and the subtitle. Look out for minor variations. For example, there is sometimes a comma before the dates at the end of a title, sometimes not. </span> </p>

           </blockquote> <p> <span __num="89" __label="true"> It is not uncommon that an author has produced several works with similar titles.

Only do this when only one title is mentioned in both notes, so that there is no uncertainty about what the 'same work' refers to. If in doubt, do not use ibid. at all; simply repeat shortened titles. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="96" __label="true"> Avoid </span> <i> <span __num="97" __label="true"> id. </span> </i> <span __num="98" __label="true"> / </span> <i> <span __num="99" __label="true"> ead. </span> </i> <span __num="100" __label="true"> ('the same male/female author').

Generally speaking, it is not necessary to give series titles if they are not numbered: e.g. Oxford Historical Monographs. If the series is numbered, it can be an awkward decision where to include it without making the whole reference rather cumbersome. One technique is to tuck the series, not italicised, inside the brackets and separated from the place and date by means of a semicolon. Thus: </span> </p> 
           <blockquote> 
            <p> <span __num="102"> M. Atkins, </span> <i> <span __num="103"> Informal Empire in Crisis: British Diplomacy and the Chinese Customs Succession, 1927-1929 </span> </i> <span __num="104"> (Cornell East Asia Series, 74; Ithaca, N.Y., 1995). </span> </p> 
           </blockquote> <p> <span __num="105" __label="true"> When referring to a multi-volume single work, it is a good idea to give the volume number as a lower-case roman numeral. This prevents any confusion with page references. Thus: </span> </p>

           </blockquote> <p> <span __num="109" __label="true"> Note two things about this reference: </span> </p> 
           <ul> 
            <li> <span __num="110" __label="true"> the use of the semicolon to separate page numbers in the different volumes </span> </li> 
            <li> <span __num="111" __label="true"> the use of a full point rather than a comma between the volume number and the first page extent - this looks better when there is a juxtaposition of lower-case roman numerals and arabic numerals. </span> </li> 
           </ul> <p> <span __num="112" __label="true"> When abbreviating book titles, use acronym-type abbreviations very sparingly. Only do so if the title is referred to very often. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="113" __label="true"> To discover the place of publication of a book, use the internal title page and the page which gives details of, </span> <i> <span __num="114" __label="true"> inter alia </span> </i> <span __num="115" __label="true"> , the ISBN number. The place of publication is </span> <u> <span __num="116" __label="true"> not </span> </u> <span __num="117" __label="true"> necessarily the same as the place where the book was set and/or printed. If two or more places of publication are given, confine your reference to the first place mentioned: this applies even if one of the other places is in the UK. So, University of Chicago Press = Chicago and London = for our purposes Chicago. To avoid confusing Cambridge (USA), home of Harvard University Press, and Cambridge (UK), home of Cambridge University Press, the state in which Cambridge (USA) is located is added to the place of publication.

For example:&nbsp; ...Its flaws have become familiar (Bose 1990a, 36-8; Cooper et al. 1990, 1-9)... The advantage of the Harvard System is that it is very neat. The disadvantage is that it makes footnotes look rather bleak, or else it breaks up the text, and it obliges the reader to refer constantly to the bibliography, whereas with the normal method one tells the reader what the full title is and then provides constant reminders by means of abbreviated titles. </span> </p> <p> <a href="#contents"> <span __num="130"> (Return to Contents) </span> </a> </p> <h3> <a id="articles" name="articles"> </a> <span __num="131" __label="true"> Articles </span> </h3> <p> <span __num="132" __label="true"> In the case of articles, it is the title of the journal which must be italicised/underlined.
