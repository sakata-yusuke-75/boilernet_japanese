      <span __num="22" __label="true"> Many educators and communities are searching for evidence on the best way to provide a high-quality education for their children and to make the best use of their education funds. One area that is of perennial interest is how to best configure the grades in local schools. Public education in the United States provides for kindergarten through grade 12 in a variety of grade arrangements, from the K-12 school to separate schools for single grades. Unfortunately, as Paglin and Fager (1997) point out: "Research has not provided definitive answers to the myriad possible questions about grade span, but the questions have never gone away. They are questions which arise whenever school reform, increasing or declining enrollment, or financial considerations bring about a reorganization of existing schools, the building of new schools, or consolidation of districts" (p. 2). Much of the research available has been done on rural or middle schools. The research on the "best" grade configuration is inconclusive. At best, it indicates factors to be considered in deciding on a school's grade span or a community's configuration of grades within its elementary and secondary school system. </span>

      <p> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Schools in the United States are organized in different ways: some schools include K-3, K-4, K-5, K-6, K-8, K-9, or K-12; others are organized as middle schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools; and still others consist of students in just one grade, such as a kindergarten center or a ninth-grade center. Some schools include pre-kindergarten. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (2002) provides data on the number of regular public school districts providing instruction and the percentage of students in membership, by grade span and by state, for the school year 2000-2001 ( </span> <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/2003310.pdf"> <span __num="34"> http://nces.ed.gov </span> </a> <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/2003310.pdf"> <span __num="35"> /pubs2003/2003310.pdf </span> </a> <span __num="36"> , Table 3). </span> </p> 
      <h2> <a name="sglconfiguration"> </a> <b> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Single-grade-level configurations </span> </b> </h2> 
      <p> <span __num="38" __label="true"> The literature suggests that some school districts have found advantages to schools that contain students at one grade level, although these advantages are not necessarily supported by research (Reents, 2002): </span> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <span __num="39" __label="true"> A single-grade center, such as a school only for ninth-graders, can develop programs specific to the needs of that age group. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Siphoning off students from several schools can relieve overcrowding at those schools. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="41" __label="true"> Students may be able to participate on an equal level in more activities and be less influenced by older students. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="42" __label="true"> The greater number of students in single-grade centers may enable the school to increase course offerings. </span> </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> <span __num="43" __label="true"> The literature also suggests some possible disadvantages to separate single-grade configurations (Hopkins, 1997): </span> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <span __num="44" __label="true"> The cost and length of student travel increases, particularly in a school district that covers a large area. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Parent involvement may decrease, possibly affected by the distance to the school and the number of schools a family's children attend. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="46" __label="true"> Students are required to make an increased number of school transitions. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Fewer opportunities are provided for interaction between age groups. </span> </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Hopkins (1997) also suggests some additional factors for school districts to consider: </span> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Combining schools into separate grade centers may affect whether neighborhood schools close or remain open. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="50" __label="true"> Current buildings may have a design more suitable for several grade levels. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="51" __label="true"> School population may increase or decrease substantially as configurations change. </span> </li> 
      </ul> 
      <h2> <a name="oconf"> </a> <b> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Other grade-level configurations: Middle schools, K-12 </span> </b> </h2> 
      <p> <span __num="53" __label="true"> "Much of what has happened with regards to school grade structure can be attributed to the development of the middle school" (Franklin &amp; Glascock, 1996, p. 4). The separation of students in grades 5 or 6 to 7 or 8 in middle schools is justified by some school districts because districts believe that middle schools better meet the developmental needs of preadolescents. As Howley (2002) points out, the developmental needs of young adolescents differ from those of elementary school children and older teenagers. "Developmentally responsive middle schools must take into account all that is known about young adolescents and the cultural context in which they live" (Lounsbury, 1996). The number of middle schools increased by 35% from 1967 to 2000 ( </span> <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d01/dt095.asp"> <span __num="54"> http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d01/dt095.asp </span> </a> <span __num="55"> ). </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> In the past decade, researchers also have demonstrated renewed interest in schools that include grades kindergarten through 12. A study of rural schools that examined the relationship between grade configuration and student achievement in Louisiana found that students in K-12 rural schools did as well or better on achievement tests as students in separate elementary, middle, or high schools. Students in high poverty areas also did better in the K-12 schools (Franklin &amp; Glascock, 1996). A similar study in Texas analyzed data from a study of 1001 Texas high schools, including 116 K-12 schools. This study produced similar results (Bickel, Howley, Williams, &amp; Glascock, 2000). </span> </p> 
      <h2> <b> <a name="hconf"> </a> <span __num="57" __label="true"> How do grade configurations affect transitions? </span> </b> </h2> 
      <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> The division of elementary schools into configurations that include fewer grades requires that students make several transitions from one school to another. Researchers note that transitions can be stressful for students: </span> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <span __num="59" __label="true"> Alspaugh (1999) found a significant achievement loss during each transition year. He also found that some students regain what is lost in the following year, but it would seem that students who make fewer transitions need fewer years to make up for achievement losses caused by transitions. </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="60" __label="true"> Another study found that each time students switched schools, their feelings of anonymity increased. Researchers who found that sixth-grade students in both elementary and combination K-12 schools outperformed students in middle schools or junior high schools considered the number of transitions a significant factor. This study considered 8 schools with 7 different grade spans with student populations of 82 to 1,200. The schools were located in both urban and rural settings in 5 northwest states. The number of grades in the schools ranged from 1 to 11 (Paglin &amp; Fager, 1997). </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="61" __label="true"> Another research study found that girls in early adolescence suffered from a drop in self-esteem, extracurricular participation, and leadership behaviors when they made the transition into middle school or junior high, but not if they remained in an elementary school setting. This study found that the effects of this transition lingered throughout the school years. For boys, the study found similar negative effects in extracurricular participation and grades, but not in self-esteem, when they made the transition into middle school or junior high. The authors concluded that the relatively protected elementary school setting made the entry into adolescence less stressful for both boys and girls. The students who had not had the stress of the earlier transition seemed to cope better with the transition into high school than did other students (Simmons &amp; Blyth, 1987). </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="62" __label="true"> Franklin and Glascock (1996) found that sixth-grade boys experienced more suspensions in middle schools or junior high schools than in elementary schools, possibly related to the effects of the transition, the school organization, or school size. This study was based on information gathered from all Louisiana public schools during the 1992-1993 school year. </span> </li> 
      </ul> 
      <h2> <a name="wconf"> </a> <span __num="63" __label="true"> What factors do school districts consider when deciding on grade configuration? </span> </h2> 
      <p> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Researchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory looked at eight schools with seven different grade spans. They examined the history of each school's decision on grade configuration along with observed advantages and disadvantages of each configuration and principals' comments on the success of their programs (Paglin &amp; Fager, 1997). Based on this research, Paglin and Fager compiled a list of nine factors that school districts might want to consider when making decisions about grade configurations of individual schools: </span> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <span __num="65" __label="true"> the cost and length of student travel, particularly in a school district that covers a large area </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="66" __label="true"> a possible increase or decrease in parent involvement, possibly affected by the distance to the school and the number of schools a family's children attend </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="67" __label="true"> the number of students at each grade level, which may affect class groupings and courses offered </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="68" __label="true"> the effect of school setting on achievement, particularly for grades 6-9 </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="69" __label="true"> effect on whether the neighborhood schools close or remain open </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="70" __label="true"> the number of school transitions for students </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="71" __label="true"> the opportunities for interaction between age groups </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="72" __label="true"> the influence of older students on younger students </span> </li> 
       <li> <span __num="73" __label="true"> the building design-is it suitable for only a few or for several grade levels? </span> </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> <span __num="74" __label="true"> Paglin and Fager concluded that designing a school system to use a particular span of grades in individual schools will not in itself guarantee that students will learn well and be well adjusted. </span> </p>

The Michigan Education Assessment Program test was used to collect data on the passing rate of students in 232 schools in a large urban inner city school district in the midwest. The results indicate that grade span configuration and school-to-school transition had significant positive and negative effects on student achievement respectively. The paper discusses implications for school districts. (Author) </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="232" __label="true"> This cross-sectional study used primarily quantitative methods to investigate the superior achievement of 4th- and 5th-grade students at Alaska's Kenai Peninsula Borough School District who as young elementary students had attended K-2 primary school, compared to peers who had attended a K-6, K-8, or K-12 configured school. Since this study was limited to a single school district that included all four elementary school configurations in communities that were found to be similar, variables that historically confuse the application of results to conclusions were systematically eliminated as causal factors. To study the effect of the remaining variables on student outcome, educational instructors that had experience teaching in both a K-2 and other configurations within the district were surveyed. The survey findings revealed the magnitude of the variance between causal agents known to affect future student success that exists in the K-2 versus other configuration elementary schools. In order of decreasing magnitude, the following variables are more prevalent in the K-2 environment than in other configurations, and their increased presence related to superior student achievement in later years: Resources, Parental Involvement, Collaboration (among administrators, teachers, and special services personnel), Foundation (ability to establish social and emotional competence, language, cognition, teaching strategies that lead to next levels of accomplishment), Relevant Teacher Training, Teacher Efficacy (with regard to aligning primary students' interests and abilities), High Expectations, Principal's Leadership, Teacher's Stability, and School Climate. (A copy of the survey is included. Contains 14 references.) </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="318" __label="true"> Research across seven very different states has shown that as schools get larger, the average achievement among economically disadvantaged students declines. A traditionally strong argument against smaller schools, however, is that they are too expensive. Large consolidated schools with narrowly specialized grade spans are typically offered as necessary to save money and to meet the needs of different age groups. This paper examines whether the size-by-socioeconomic status interaction effect proves robust across alternative regression model specifications, as it did across different states. It also explores whether the equity gains associated with smaller schools are incompatible with the need to save money. Analysis with four different regression model specifications consistently found that increased school size was related to increases in achievement-test-score costs associated with economically disadvantaged students. School size was negatively related to expenditure per pupil, but this relationship became increasingly tenuous as size increased, and eventually savings became negligible. In addition, organizational factors, especially as manifest in the distinctive components of the single-unit school, were related to cost reduction. For those interested in balancing expenditure per pupil with achievement-based equity, the best grade-span configuration seems to be a small single-unit school. (Contains 76 references.)

      <p> <span __num="330" __label="true"> Research has revealed interactive effects of school size and socioeconomic status--as school size increases, the mean measured achievement of schools with disadvantaged students declines. The larger the number of less advantaged students attending a school, the greater the decline. This study also examined the claim that large schools with a narrow range of grades necessarily save money by achieving economies of scale. Results indicate that school size was negatively related to costs, but this relationship became increasingly tenuous as school size increased, with savings eventually becoming negligible. In addition, analysis of organizational factors distinct to the single-unit school indicates that if schools are designed solely to minimize expenditure per pupil, the best configuration may be a large single-unit school. However, if expenditure per pupil is balanced with achievement-based equity, the best configuration seems to be one small single-unit school per district. While decreased size would increase costs, the fact that there is only one school with 13-15 grade levels would substantially diminish costs. (Contains 69 references.) (TD) </span> </p>

The booklet examines questions relating to grade configurations, its purpose being to increase awareness and understanding of the issues surrounding grade span. It explores the ways that schools have addressed concerns associated with particular grade spans and suggests avenues for further inquiry. The text focuses on historical trends in grade configuration and the various contexts of grade spans, such as whether a school is in a rural or an urban area. Most research on grade span focuses on the middle grades and addresses such questions as: Which grades should be grouped together in one school? How many grades should be in one school? and How many school transitions will students make during the K-12 years? Some tips for starting a school with a grade span new to a school system are offered, followed by an overview of grade-span considerations. The bulk of the volume describes eight schools' experiences with grade spans, discussing such issues as how the grade span came about and how the schools were structured to meet the needs of the particular grades it contains.

Of the 706 districts operating unit schools, 157 districts in 27 states responded to the survey. The majority of respondents (106) were superintendents of one-school districts, that is, districts in which the K-12 unit school was the only school. Of the 53 multischool districts, about half operated just one K-12 unit school. Data reveal that K-12 unit schools were usually located in an agricultural region where socioeconomic status was lower than the national average; the average unit school enrollment was 414; most unit schools in multischool districts were comparatively remote from key resources such as hospitals, interstate highways, and cities; superintendents of single-school districts reported higher rates of above-average test scores, postsecondary attendance, and high school completion than did superintendents of multischool districts; satellite and Internet systems were the most prevalent forms of distance learning technologies in use; community attitudes toward single-school districts were moderately and positively related to the sustainability of the school; single-school districts spent almost 50 percent more per pupil than multischool districts; and single-school districts more often than multischool districts employed cooperative strategies for maximizing resources such as joining regional service agencies or cooperating with other districts.

Results indicate that sixth- and seventh-grade students performed better in elementary and K-12 schools than in middle or secondary schools, in terms of both achievement and persistence. Students in K-12 schools performed as well as those in elementary schools overall and performed better in some cases (grade 6 and high poverty). For grades 9-12, the K-12 school was more beneficial to students than the traditional secondary school, particularly in the area of student persistence or conduct. With regard to academic achievement, secondary schools did not differ significantly from K-12 schools regardless of school size or SES. School size did appear to impact 11th- and 12th-grade student persistence more within the secondary school environment than that of the K-12 school.

      <p> <span __num="463" __label="true"> During 1968-91, middle schools were the only school type to grow in number, increasing by over 400 percent. Middle school advocates focus on early adolescents' need for developmentally appropriate institutions, but show only a weak historical understanding of the emergence and status of middle schools. Critical factors in early support for the middle school movement included urban interests in countering de facto school segregation without use of busing, urban overcrowding of elementary and high schools, and a "bandwagon effect"--the desire to appear modern and reform oriented. The emergence of rural middle schools under the cloak of psychological progress can be destructive to both the declining sense of community in America, and to the actual persistence of many rural communities still organized around K-8 or K-6 public elementary schools. Examination of the National Center for Education Statistics's Common Core of Data indicates that the construction of rural middle schools has led to the closing and consolidation of rural elementary schools. During the school years 1987/88-1991/92 the proportion of schools that were middle schools increased 20 percent in rural areas, was unchanged in suburban areas, and decreased 6 percent in urban areas. At the same time, the proportion of rural schools that were K-8 declined precipitously. Emerging school reform agendas that provide alternatives to the "inevitability" of consolidation include efforts to restructure schools as caring communities (requiring active parent and community participation), and the development of rural schools as centers for integrated social services.

Following a brief summary of the origins of the middle school is a discussion of survey results regarding changes in rationale and specific preparation undertaken for introducing middle school organization and problems perceived in teacher education. Finally, conclusions are presented regarding the differences between schools containing grades 5-8 or 6-8 and those with grades 7 and 8 or 7-9. Included are four tables and five graphs.

The research is intended to assist policymakers confronted with implementation decisions regarding middle level programs. Future research should focus on program effectiveness relative to "transescents'" needs and to goals established by the individual school.

The organization of the middle school (commonly the grades 6-8), however, is based on a philosophy of education that was specifically designed to meet the special needs of a preadolescent learner; middle schools incorporate unique curricula to better effect the transition between elementary and high school programs, rather than attempt to approximate one or the other. Many educators, perceiving junior highs as a "failed" promise, have turned to the middle school philosophy as an affirmation of a higher level of commitment. Indeed, since 1964, the number of new middle schools replacing traditional junior highs has progressively increased. A review of research on middle-level education indicates that: (1) although primarily an administrative concern driven by attendance boundaries, grade level organization had little impact on middle-level students' academic achievement; and (2) the terms "junior high school" and "middle school" do not define a school's program. Additionally, the effective schools research has given rise to discriminant analyses of effective middle school variables and allowed researchers to identify those characteristics most commonly found within "exemplary" middle schools.

The grade organization studies of various middle grade configurations did not show any consistent effects one way or the other. References to 36 studies are included. (SI) </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="601" __label="true"> In the United States, a "two-tiered" school system--elementary and secondary education--is often spoken of, yet throughout this century the trend has been toward a "three tiered" system--elementary, junior high/intermediate/middle school, and high school. This paper reviews literature and research regarding these trends, the advantages and disadvantages of both systems, and the effects of grade organization patterns on students. Particular emphasis is given to the middle/junior high school system. The paper concludes with suggestions for changing grade organization patterns. Appendixes include references, a chart showing secondary grade organization patterns, and an outline of advantages and disadvantages in the systems. (CB) </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="612" __label="true"> This literature review concerns the concept of alternative grade configurations at the elementary level, in which elementary schools are subdivided into primary (K-2) and intermediate (3-5) units. Because of the paucity of literature on this concept, the major part of the report focuses on the reorganization of the elementary schools of the South Allegheny (Pennsylvania) school district. Although the K-2, 3-5 structure is often implemented in response to declining enrollment, other educational benefits cited may include better concentration on the educational and psychological needs of children in the two age groups, though one research study showed no significant differences in student achievement, attitude toward school, extracurricular participation, or career aspiration. The goals of the South Allegheny reorganization (in response to declining enrollment) were to equalize class sizes to facilitate multilevel instruction in reading and math, and to make better use of staff, school buildings, and instructional resources. Each of these objectives is described in detail, along with perceived disadvantages. An evaluative report revealed that the new grade structure saved money and resulted in improved discipline, student attitudes, and student interaction. Finally, literature on the implementation process is briefly reviewed, emphasizing the need for clear articulation between grade levels. Notes and references are included. (TE) </span> </p>
