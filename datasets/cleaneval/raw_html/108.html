If Australians canreconstruct their political system to meet the demands of a society vastlydifferent from Federation in 1900, having greatly advanced technology at itsdisposal and possessing superior transport and communication systems as well asphysical resources, how will they do it? Would there still be any need for afederal system at all? Or would it be a huge hindrance to effective government?Would there still be need a for some 830 politicians? Should they introduce atwo-tiered system of elected Government and enable the majority party orcoalition to select the Ministry from outside Parliament rather than appointcareer politicians? Surely the issue is no longer whether Australia should be aRepublic OR continue to be an outpost of a rather shaky constitutional monarchywhich has little interest in her distant Dominion. Improving the processes ofGovernment in Australia, steeped in 200 years British colonial and Westminstertraditions, is a task habitually avoided by both major parties. Unless it's doneAustralia may no longer in business on account of its antiquated constitutionand political system. More likely it will be governed by the Boards of Directorsof foreign Multi National Enterprises through a comprador class of well-paidcompliant Australian managers and politicians. That trend is unmistakablealready. The PLP intends to create a real democracy in Australia. </span> </p>

The electoral systemhas kept that now sterile, male dominated, two-party system in place for far toolong. A greater variety of interests, persons and cultures should be representedin the National Parliament. The role of the citizens in constitutional changehas been minimal and tokenistic. The initiative and timing of referendums is theprerogative of the Government of the day. Almost every constitutional referendumturns into a political slanging match regardless of the merits of the proposal(s).Only eight of many such referendums have been successful over the 100 years offederation. The rejection of the four proposals of the 1988 referendumdemonstrated the present Constitution's dangerous inflexibility once again.Updating the Constitution has proven to be far too difficult. The result hasbeen to devise expensive ways to circumvent it, often unsuccessfully, a recipefor stagnation and deterioration. </span> </p>

Australiansneed to rewrite the entire constitution. The idea that the constitution cannotbe replaced by another one, supposedly because it can only be amended (and thenonly in terms of the highly unsatisfactory amending clause, section 128), is nomore than a legal fiction. It suggests that the legal system ultimately rulesAustralia rather than the people. This line of argument, frequently voiced byso-called constitutional experts, suggests that today's Australians are shackledby past agreements among some of the citizens who voted on the 1900 ConstitutionDraft in a VOLUNTARY referendum 100 YEARS AGO. </span> </p>
