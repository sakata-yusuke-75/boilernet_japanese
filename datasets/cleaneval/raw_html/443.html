         <hr color="#800000" noshade> <p align="CENTER"> <strong> <span __num="11" __label="true"> Introduction </span> </strong> </p> <p align="left"> <span __num="12" __label="true"> Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here, and I am honored to be back at the FTC as its Chairman. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="13" __label="true"> As many of you may know, this is my third tour at the FTC. I first served as Assistant to the Director of the Office of Policy Planning and Evaluation in the mid 1970s. I returned in 1981 to serve as the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and then became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983. I am fully committed to the institution and its mission of protecting consumers through actively enforcing our antitrust and consumer protection laws. I return as Chairman with great anticipation of the challenges and excitement that lie ahead. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="14" __label="true"> There has been considerable speculation about possible changes at the Commission. Some predicted that there would be substantial continuity from the previous administration, with changes mainly at the margins. Others agreed that there would be continuity but hedged their bets - they were uncertain how wide the margins might be. Others predicted - perhaps wishfully - that changes would be more dramatic. For example, they anticipated substantially reduced merger enforcement. I expect the last group will be disappointed. A vigorous enforcement program is necessary to fulfill the agency's mission to protect consumers. The first group has it right. Continuity will be the norm, with changes at the margins. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="15" __label="true"> We have assembled a first-rate staff. In the operating Bureaus, we have: Howard Beales, Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection; Bill Kovacic, General Counsel; David Scheffman, Director of the Bureau of Economics; and Joe Simons, Director of the Bureau of Competition. All have extensive experience in their fields; each has substantial prior experience at the FTC; and each has extensive post-FTC experience related to the agency's mission. Joining this group are Anna Davis, Director of Congressional Relations, who also previously worked at the FTC, Rosemarie Straight, who remains as Executive Director, and two newcomers: Ted Cruz, who is our new Director of Policy Planning, and Cathy MacFarlane, who will head our Office of Public Affairs. I appointed these individuals because of their superb qualifications and, like me, they are committed to the FTC and its mission. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> Today, I will sketch a vision of the landscape ahead. Along the way, I will retrace the origins of some of the policies that I expect to follow. You will see that continuity should not come as a surprise. There is much ground to cover, and I will touch on each topic only briefly. You will hear more about each of these subjects in the coming months. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="17" __label="true"> Before continuing, I should repeat the standard disclaimer that my remarks today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Commission or of any other Commissioner. </span> </p> <p align="center"> <strong> <span __num="18" __label="true"> I. Why Should We Expect Continuity? </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="19" __label="true"> Antitrust has become an area of bipartisan cooperation. Although there are disagreements about specific cases, there is widespread agreement that the purpose of antitrust is to protect consumers, that economic analysis should guide case selection, and that horizontal cases, both mergers and agreements among competitors, are the mainstays of antitrust. Moreover, today there is bipartisan recognition that antitrust law is a way of helping to organize our economy. A freely functioning market, subject to the rules of antitrust, provides maximum benefits to consumers. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> Bob Pitofsky's tenure as FTC Chairman was in that vein of bipartisanship. In fact, he and his appointees praised the leadership of his predecessor, Janet Steiger, who was appointed by the first President Bush. Bob was clearly one of the most effective Chairmen in the history of the Commission. </span> <a href="#N_1_"> <sup> <span __num="21"> (1) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="22" __label="true"> Of course, Bob brought his intellect, scholarship, and management skills to the job. But a key reason for Bob's success as Chairman was that his agenda and enforcement policies reflected the bipartisan consensus. Those policies were not significantly different from those of his predecessor in the previous administration. There were changes at the margins, and, as would any new chairman, Bob faced some new challenges. That is my message today - there will be some changes at the margins, but mainly there will be continuity. There will not be a sea change in enforcement. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> Bob Pitofsky set a high standard, and he should be applauded for his efforts on behalf of consumers. He and I may differ on certain points, but I, too, intend to characterize my tenure by what I do, rather than what I do not do. Let me turn to some specific areas of antitrust. </span> </p> <p align="CENTER"> <strong> <span __num="24" __label="true"> II. Merger Enforcement </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="25" __label="true"> This year is the 25 </span> <sup> <span __num="26" __label="true"> th </span> </sup> <span __num="27" __label="true"> anniversary of the passage of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. </span> <a href="#N_2_"> <sup> <span __num="28"> (2) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="29" __label="true"> The passage of HSR and the resulting evolution of merger enforcement policy has undoubtedly been the most important statutory development in antitrust for several decades. Like antitrust enforcement generally, merger enforcement is about protecting consumers from unwarranted exercise of market power. As the Chairman of the FTC, I take that mandate very seriously. I do not see significant change in basic merger enforcement from the Pitofsky Commission. We will apply the Merger Guidelines </span> <a href="#N_3_"> <sup> <span __num="30"> (3) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="31" __label="true"> to the available facts, as did the Pitofsky Commission. Problematic mergers will face the same hurdles they did during the 1990s. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="32" __label="true"> A. Evolution of Merger Policy in the 1970s and Early 1980s </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Let me add some historical perspective on why continuity is appropriate. By the time of the </span> <em> <span __num="34" __label="true"> General Dynamics </span> </em> <span __num="35" __label="true"> decision in 1974, </span> <a href="#N_4_"> <sup> <span __num="36"> (4) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="37" __label="true"> it was clear that merger policy would have to change to reflect new realities. Cases like </span> <em> <span __num="38" __label="true"> Von's </span> </em> <span __num="39" __label="true"> were relics of the past. </span> <a href="#N_5_"> <sup> <span __num="40"> (5) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="41" __label="true"> Economic research debunked the fears of market concentration at even low levels. </span> <a href="#N_6_"> <sup> <span __num="42"> (6) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="43" __label="true"> Rigid reliance on concentration statistics and structural presumptions would no longer suffice; we would have to look at the competitive dynamics of the market. There was growing awareness that we live in a global economy - market boundaries don't necessarily end at the U.S. border. And there was a growing realization that efficiencies are important. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Those changes were reflected in 1982 Merger Guidelines, </span> <a href="#N_7_"> <sup> <span __num="45"> (7) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="46" __label="true"> promulgated during Bill Baxter's regime at the Antitrust Division. The new Guidelines were a milestone in antitrust. They incorporated an economically sound analytical structure that was workable in practice and provided clear guideposts for businesses and antitrust practitioners. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> The 1982 Guidelines laid the foundation for today's merger enforcement. Although improved over the years, the core analytical structure remains the same. The Guidelines have stood the test of time and have become even more influential. The courts increasingly follow them, and they have greatly influenced merger enforcement across the world. Bill Baxter is, unfortunately, no longer with us, but his legacy lives on. His Guidelines were applied by Bob Pitofsky's Commission, and I expect to do the same. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> In fact, I was one of the early implementers of the 1982 Guidelines' analytical structure. We were an active, even proactive Commission back then. I became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983, and during my 2½ years in that position, we dealt with matters such as: </span> </p>

         </ul> <p> <span __num="76" __label="true"> These were important cases, and their influence is present today. Our analysis of the </span> <em> <span __num="77" __label="true"> Texaco/Getty </span> </em> <span __num="78" __label="true"> and </span> <em> <span __num="79" __label="true"> SoCal/Gulf </span> </em> <span __num="80" __label="true"> transactions, and the 1982 FTC Oil Merger Report, </span> <a href="#N_16_"> <sup> <span __num="81"> (16) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="82" __label="true"> laid out most of the basics of how the FTC has analyzed much larger oil mergers over the past decade. The consumer products merger investigation was one of the first to use statistical methodologies to analyze substitutability of branded products. That analysis by our Bureau of Economics stimulated further research and paved the way for today's major cottage industry of economists doing econometric analyses of consumer demand for branded products. </span> </p> <p> <em> <span __num="83" __label="true"> Warner-Polygram </span> </em> <span __num="84" __label="true"> presented very complex issues in analyzing coordinated interaction in a dynamic industry that thrives by constantly developing new, differentiated products. Both </span> <em> <span __num="85" __label="true"> Warner-Polygram </span> </em> <span __num="86" __label="true"> and the two </span> <em> <span __num="87" __label="true"> carbon black </span> </em> <span __num="88" __label="true"> mergers were successfully challenged in court. The </span> <em> <span __num="89" __label="true"> Warner-Polygram </span> </em> <span __num="90" __label="true"> decision has been very influential in the Commission's ability to obtain preliminary injunctions under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="91" __label="true"> Finally, the Commission's lengthy, very extensive investigation of the GM-Toyota joint venture was important, both for the U.S. automobile industry and American consumers, and in guiding later thinking about joint ventures. Our examination of the potential efficiencies of the joint venture was controversial at the time. Today, however, there are few who would argue with allowing the venture to proceed. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="92" __label="true"> B. The Importance of Facts </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="93" __label="true"> Those of you who were involved with mergers in those early days following the 1982 Guidelines know that we all had a lot to learn. This was particularly true of the Guidelines' new approach to market definition. We also quickly learned that merger analysis under this new regime was incredibly </span> <strong> <em> <span __num="94" __label="true"> fact intensive </span> </em> </strong> <span __num="95" __label="true"> . </span> </p> <p> <span __num="96" __label="true"> John Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of this country, once discussed facts in a manner directly relevant for us today. In 1770, Adams defended the British officer and soldiers accused of murder in the Boston Massacre. He said: </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="97" __label="true"> Facts are stubborn things </span> </strong> <span __num="98" __label="true"> ; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. </span> <a href="#N_17_"> <sup> <span __num="99"> (17) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="100" __label="true"> Stubborn facts are what changed antitrust law and enforcement after the 1970s. For example, a 1983 Washington Post editorial on the GM-Toyota joint venture stated: </span> </p> 
         <blockquote> 
          <p> <span __num="101" __label="true"> [T]he rules of antitrust law as they had developed [in the 1960s and 1970s] were undermined by observation of how the world works. </span> <a href="#N_18_"> <sup> <span __num="102"> (18) </span> </sup> </a> </p> 
         </blockquote> <p> <span __num="103" __label="true"> We learned long ago that </span> <em> <span __num="104" __label="true"> facts are stubborn things </span> </em> <span __num="105" __label="true"> in merger enforcement. No economic theory or story-based advocacy about a merger will give you a reliable answer unless the facts firmly support it. This is absolutely as it should be. This is why no change in Administration or change in faces in the agencies will significantly change merger enforcement. Just as we have the burden of proving that a merger likely will be anticompetitive, you will need to demonstrate with sound, stubborn fact-based analyses the claims that you make. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="106" __label="true"> C. Maintaining the Basic Approach </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="107" __label="true"> By saying that there will be continuity, I do not mean to suggest that I agreed with every specific enforcement action of the Pitofsky Commission; I did not. Overwhelmingly, however, when the parties pushed the Commission into court, the Commission won. So, how stubborn do your facts have to be? I agree with the approach of the Pitofsky Commission. If a merger appears problematic, the facts on your side have to be stubborn enough to convince a federal judge that we cannot obtain a preliminary injunction. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="108" __label="true"> I know that some in the press and the Bar think that the Bush administration will relax antitrust enforcement. I urge them, and you, to watch what we do. I can tell you unequivocally that if you come in with transactions that would not fly in the past, you are likely to "crash"unless you have compelling, stubborn facts on your side. To some of you, let me say it more bluntly. A few members of the merger bar have been telling the press that we are going to have more relaxed standards. Those folks will be doing their actual or potential clients a big disservice if those clients act on that presumption. If you are an experienced merger attorney, you know a problematic merger when you see it. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="109" __label="true"> D. Attention to Competitive Effects Theories </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="110" __label="true"> Staying the course does not mean that we will stop thinking about the theories we apply. Theories of anticompetitive effects have evolved over time, and will continue to do so. For example, although we have always had what could be called "unilateral effects" theories, they have evolved, and they have been more widely applied since the 1992 revision of the Guidelines. </span> <a href="#N_19_"> <sup> <span __num="111"> (19) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="112" __label="true"> Some question whether the agency has gone too far in applying unilateral effects theories. One argument is that we may be in danger of returning to antitrust that focused on the elimination of competition between the parties to the merger, rather than competition at the market level. I would not go that far. It is too early to tell whether theory has outstripped reality. I do agree that we should be sure that we have the facts to apply a unilateral effects theory. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="113" __label="true"> The analysis of unilateral effects often relies substantially on econometric analysis of scanner data. We need to understand better the potential limitations of the data. Although the analysis is highly complex, the theories underlying merger simulation models are based on simple and restrictive assumptions. These can be useful tools, but we are looking at them more closely to understand better their strengths and limitations. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="114" __label="true"> Coordinated interaction theories have also evolved. In recent years there has been more focus on theories of coordinated interaction involving alleged price discrimination. This is an area in which facts are particularly important. We all understand that price </span> <em> <span __num="115" __label="true"> differences </span> </em> <span __num="116" __label="true"> , themselves, are not evidence of price discrimination. Price discrimination requires, among other things, "systematic" pricing policies that result in evidence of </span> <em> <span __num="117" __label="true"> actual </span> </em> <span __num="118" __label="true"> transaction prices that is consistent with a theory of price discrimination. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="119" __label="true"> E. Areas Where Enforcement Policy is Still Evolving </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="120" __label="true"> Although the basics of merger enforcement are firmly in place, there are important substantive areas that are still evolving: "high tech"mergers involving significant innovation issues; efficiencies; and remedies. </span> </p> 
         <dl> 
          <dd> 
           <em> <strong> <span __num="121" __label="true"> High Tech Mergers </span> </strong> </em> 
          </dd> 
         </dl> <p> <span __num="122" __label="true"> Merger analysis in "high tech" industries is not fundamentally different than in other industries. The basic Guidelines analysis can be applied. We should proceed, however, cognizant of our lesser experience in high tech industries. Moreover, the high tech arena, by its nature, is constantly changing. New high tech industries, often with new technical issues, continue to be born and to change. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="123" __label="true"> One aspect of high tech may warrant especially close scrutiny. The fierce competition for success in these industries often results in the "winner" enjoying a (perhaps short-lived) monopoly. We should be especially reluctant to allow those firms to merge with actual (or potential) competitors. This was part of the basis for my criticism of the Clinton Antitrust Division's failure to challenge the Microsoft-Web TV merger. </span> <a href="#N_20_"> <sup> <span __num="124"> (20) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="125" __label="true"> Given the relative newness of applying the Guidelines to high tech industries, we should assess the effects of our enforcement actions, as well as monitor the outcomes when we decide not to intervene. We will look for opportunities to use the Bureau of Economics in these retrospective examinations to help inform future decisions. </span> </p> 
         <dl> 
          <dd> 
           <em> <strong> <span __num="126" __label="true"> Efficiencies </span> </strong> </em> 
          </dd> 
         </dl> <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> The agencies have come far in recognizing the significance of merger efficiencies. In 1980, I wrote an article arguing that the agencies should recognize the relevance of merger efficiency claims. </span> <a href="#N_21_"> <sup> <span __num="128"> (21) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="129" __label="true"> Today, there is no question that they are relevant, as the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines reflected. The 1997 revision of the Efficiencies section of the Guidelines further improved the analytical treatment of efficiencies. And a growing number of courts now recognize the relevance of efficiency claims. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Despite this progress, the treatment of efficiencies in merger enforcement has room for further improvement. I have argued that the agencies should recognize additional classes of efficiencies, and that their argument in court is still much too hostile. </span> <a href="#N_22_"> <sup> <span __num="131"> (22) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="132" __label="true"> The analysis will continue to evolve based on facts and study. These are changes at the margin, however. From my experience in the 1980s and as a consultant, few cases will turn solely on the efficiency issue. The bedrock principle of merger enforcement remains the same - protect consumers. In efficiencies, as in any other analysis, the facts are crucial. Efficiency claims that are not firmly based in stubborn facts will be given no weight. </span> </p>

           <em> <strong> <span __num="133" __label="true"> Remedies </span> </strong> </em> 
          </dd> 
         </dl> <p> <span __num="134" __label="true"> The Commission's recent posture on merger remedies is controversial within the bar. Merger remedies, like other aspects of antitrust, have evolved during the last 20 years. During much of the 1980s, the agency resolved cases relatively less frequently with settlements. When we did settle, however, we insisted on strong structural relief. Our lengthy review and negotiations for remedies in the Texaco-Getty matter in 1984 led some lawyers for Texaco to suggest that we were a distraction from their goals. That view of our role is misinformed. An effective remedy is a fundamental part of merger enforcement. Now, as then, we must protect consumers, not help you get your deal through at consumers' expense. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="135" __label="true"> One of the techniques the Commission has recently used is an up-front buyer of divested assets. Much of the criticism in the Bar has been that the process of identifying and vetting an up-front buyer slows down the settlement process. A countervailing consideration is that an up-front buyer can provide added assurance that a settlement will work as planned. It may be particularly useful when proposed divestiture involves an asset package that constitutes less than an ongoing business, whose viability is somewhat uncertain, or assets that may deteriorate over time. There is thus an appropriate use for up-front buyers on occasion. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="136" __label="true"> An up-front buyer is not an end in itself, of course. Our principal goal is to protect consumers. We will require a divestiture that will likely create a viable </span> <strong> <em> <span __num="137" __label="true"> business entity </span> </em> </strong> <span __num="138" __label="true"> (rather than a creation of lawyers) to resolve the competitive problems posed by the merger. We may be confident before identifying one specific buyer that acceptable candidates exist. As with so much else of modern merger analysis, the issue is highly fact specific. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="139" __label="true"> F. The Merger Review Process </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="140" __label="true"> As I noted earlier, this year marks the 25 </span> <sup> <span __num="141" __label="true"> th </span> </sup> <span __num="142" __label="true"> Anniversary of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. A lot has changed. When I became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983, the merger review process under HSR was still evolving; we were still on the learning curve. Today, we have a well-functioning program in place - not perfect, as all of you will agree, but it does a remarkable job. We have a smaller professional staff than we did in the early 1980s, as well as fewer support staff, but we review many times more merger filings. We have highly skilled and dedicated lawyers and economists, and an excellent senior management team. The Bureau of Competition and Bureau of Economics work closely together. Merger review is firmly grounded in facts and sound economic analysis. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="143" __label="true"> But as I said, not all is perfect. Thousands of mergers are filed each year, and some questionable transactions may slip through the screening process. The recent amendments to the HSR Act, which increased the filing threshold, may have made it more likely that we will miss a few problematic transactions. I have directed BC Director Joe Simons to increase our efforts in reviewing the business press and other sources to identify potentially problematic mergers. If you have clients that are concerned with a transaction, let us know - </span> <em> <span __num="144" __label="true"> whether or not it has been consummated </span> </em> <span __num="145" __label="true"> . We are quite prepared to go after consummated mergers or mergers that are too small to require an HSR filing. In addition, we will continue to vigorously pursue parties who do not comply with the procedural requirements of the HSR regulations, our first line of defense against anticompetitive mergers. Some of you may recall that, during my tenure as Bureau Director, we brought the first 7(a) case. </span> <a href="#N_23_"> <sup> <span __num="146"> (23) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="147" __label="true"> Let me turn now to 2 </span> <sup> <span __num="148" __label="true"> nd </span> </sup> <span __num="149" __label="true"> Requests. The burdens of the 2 </span> <sup> <span __num="150" __label="true"> nd </span> </sup> <span __num="151" __label="true"> Request process continue to be a concern. Although the agencies have made substantial efforts to reduce the burden, there is room for further improvement. The number of boxes of documents submitted for a typical 2 </span> <sup> <span __num="152" __label="true"> nd </span> </sup> <span __num="153" __label="true"> Request has sky-rocketed. Where once we had hundreds of boxes, in some matters we now have </span> <em> <span __num="154" __label="true"> thousands </span> </em> <span __num="155" __label="true"> of boxes. Of course, some mergers are very complex and tend to involve volumes of documents. Moreover, I have worked on enough mergers to know that you are not always trying to make the agency's job easy. In any event, given the burdens involved for both the merging parties and agency staff, we need to find ways to do our jobs more efficiently. We need to ensure that what you submit is as helpful as possible to our doing our job of protecting consumers. We will have more to say about this in the coming months. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="156" __label="true"> We are also trying to make merger investigations more efficient in other ways. As we all know, the statutory deadlines are almost never binding for a problematic merger. Because the deadlines are too short to analyze a complex merger fully, we usually arrange an accommodation for more time. Nonetheless, merger investigations, on average, probably take longer than necessary. We will try to expedite the process further. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="157" __label="true"> Improved communication is part of the answer. Both sides have to join issue on the critical aspects of a merger. If a merger appears problematic, the burden is on the parties to convince us that there are no problems or that any problems can be fully remedied with a suitable divestiture. Without jeopardizing our position in potential litigation, we can probably communicate more clearly to the parties the bases of our concerns. Joe Simons and I are working to develop and implement procedures to improve the merger review process without compromising the ability to do our job. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="158" __label="true"> In that vein, we will be conducting "best practices" sessions with the Antitrust Division, beginning with 2d Request and remedies issues, to strengthen both of our agencies. In addition, the Bureau of Competition is planning a series of "brown bag" lunches in Washington, D.C., and some of our regional offices to discuss your concerns about remedies. We hope that these steps will offer additional bases for improving the merger review process. </span> </p> <p align="center"> <strong> <span __num="159" __label="true"> III. International Antitrust </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="160" __label="true"> Let me turn to a new topic: competition policy in a global economy. Increasingly, U.S. companies and the U.S. antitrust agencies interact with our competition law counterparts. These interactions raise a multitude of procedural and substantive issues. The FTC is certain to give increasing attention to these international issues. Among other matters, we will: </span> </p>

To manage this function, I have appointed my long-time friend Jim Hamill to be Senior Counsel for International Affairs in the General Counsel's office.

Non-Merger Enforcement </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="167" __label="true"> Let me move to a brief discussion of non-merger enforcement. There are several important issues here, such as competition in pharmaceuticals and intellectual property issues. As in the case of merger enforcement, facts are critical. Our cases will be empirically grounded. Sound theory is important, but it must fit the facts of the case. </span> <a href="#N_24_"> <sup> <span __num="168"> (24) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="169" __label="true"> My interest in non-merger enforcement should not be surprising. The Commission was very active in pursuing non-merger matters when I was the Director of the Bureau of Competition in the early1980s. During my tenure, we put 17 non-merger cases in "Part III" administrative litigation. Important cases such as </span> <em> <span __num="170" __label="true"> TICOR </span> </em> <span __num="171" __label="true"> , </span> <a href="#N_25_"> <sup> <span __num="172"> (25) </span> </sup> </a> <em> <span __num="173" __label="true"> Superior Court Trial Lawyers Ass'n, </span> <a href="#N_26_"> <sup> <span __num="174"> (26) </span> </sup> </a> </em> <em> <span __num="175" __label="true"> Mass Board </span> </em> <span __num="176" __label="true"> , </span> <a href="#N_27_"> <sup> <span __num="177"> (27) </span> </sup> </a> <em> <span __num="178" __label="true"> Detroit Auto Dealers, </span> </em> <a href="#N_28_"> <sup> <span __num="179"> (28) </span> </sup> </a> <em> <span __num="180" __label="true"> Taxicabs </span> </em> <span __num="181" __label="true"> , </span> <a href="#N_29_"> <sup> <span __num="182"> (29) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="183" __label="true"> and </span> <em> <span __num="184" __label="true"> U-Haul </span> </em> <a href="#N_30_"> <sup> <span __num="185"> (30) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="186" __label="true"> were among that group.

We used to believe that antitrust counseling, at least for major companies, would generally deter anticompetitive conduct. We have learned, however, from </span> <em> <span __num="189" __label="true"> ADM </span> </em> <span __num="190" __label="true"> , </span> <a href="#N_32_"> <sup> <span __num="191"> (32) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="192" __label="true"> the vitamins case, </span> <a href="#N_33_"> <sup> <span __num="193"> (33) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="194" __label="true"> numerous other price-fixing cases, and from </span> <em> <span __num="195" __label="true"> Microsoft </span> </em> <span __num="196" __label="true"> , </span> <a href="#N_34_"> <sup> <span __num="197"> (34) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="198" __label="true"> that the antitrust agencies must aggressively police competitive conduct. In a recent matter the Commission issued Complaints because there was reason to believe that competitors engaged in </span> <em> <span __num="199" __label="true"> per se </span> </em> <span __num="200" __label="true"> violations. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="201" __label="true"> Let me now explore a few areas of current interest. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="202" __label="true"> A. Hatch-Waxman Issues </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="203" __label="true"> The Pitofsky Commission was very active in looking at potential abuses of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which was intended to promote generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry. We are continuing those efforts. The competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry is very important to American consumers. We have a number of active, ongoing investigations, and we are also conducting a study of Hatch-Waxman related issues. As you probably know, a number of legislative proposals have been made to modify Hatch-Waxman to curb the alleged abuses. Our study and our experience in investigating these issues may provide some guidance for potential modifications of the Act. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="204" __label="true"> B. Horizontal Emphasis </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="205" __label="true"> It is uncontroversial that horizontal activities should be a major focus of non-merger enforcement. You can be sure that we are going to be very active in finding, investigating, and bringing actions against anticompetitive horizontal activities. We already have a number of new initiatives under way. The professions and health care are areas of particular interest. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="206" __label="true"> One of the issues we will be dealing with is the legal standard for judging some of these horizontal agreements. When I was at the Bureau of Competition in the 1980s, we developed a truncated rule of reason analysis that the Commission adopted in </span> <em> <span __num="207" __label="true"> Massachusetts Bd. of Registration of Optometry. </span> </em> <a href="#N_35_"> <sup> <span __num="208"> (35) </span> </sup> </a> <em> <span __num="209" __label="true"> Mass Board </span> </em> <span __num="210" __label="true"> applied a structured analysis that avoided a rigid </span> <em> <span __num="211" __label="true"> per se </span> </em> <span __num="212" __label="true"> /rule of reason categorization. It provided an intermediate form of analysis for inherently suspect restraints that appear likely, absent an efficiency justification, to restrict competition and reduce output. The Commission decided not to apply the </span> <em> <span __num="213" __label="true"> Mass Board </span> </em> <span __num="214" __label="true"> methodology in the </span> <em> <span __num="215" __label="true"> California Dental Association </span> </em> <span __num="216" __label="true"> case, opting instead to use the traditional </span> <em> <span __num="217" __label="true"> per se </span> </em> <span __num="218" __label="true"> /rule of reason categorization. It held the advertising restraints in that case to be unlawful under both the </span> <em> <span __num="219" __label="true"> per se </span> </em> <span __num="220" __label="true"> standard and an abbreviated rule of reason analysis. The Ninth Circuit affirmed under the abbreviated rule of reason theory, but the Supreme Court reversed, holding the Commission's analysis to be too abbreviated. What is required, said the Court, is "an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint." </span> <a href="#N_36_"> <sup> <span __num="221"> (36) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="222" __label="true"> It therefore teaches that facts, not rigid categories, should guide the analysis. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="223" __label="true"> In light of </span> <em> <span __num="224" __label="true"> CDA </span> </em> <span __num="225" __label="true"> , we have more work to do to develop a workable approach that is consistent with the law. I believe the Commission would have prevailed in that case had it been tried under the </span> <em> <span __num="226" __label="true"> Mass Board </span> </em> <span __num="227" __label="true"> standard, with record evidence to explain why the advertising restraints should be analyzed under a truncated approach. That evidence was available. There is plentiful empirical evidence demonstrating the deleterious effects on price and quality flowing from restrictions on professional advertising, but the record contained precious little of that evidence. Regardless of the precise form of truncated analysis one chooses to use, the key to prosecuting such a case successfully is to build a record that contains support for claims of probable anticompetitive effect. </span> <a href="#N_37_"> <sup> <span __num="228"> (37) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="229" __label="true"> Two other issues we will be looking at are the </span> <em> <span __num="230" __label="true"> Noerr-Pennington </span> </em> <span __num="231" __label="true"> and State Action exemptions. You may recall that we brought cases involving these areas during my stint as Competition Bureau Director in the 1980s - </span> <em> <span __num="232" __label="true"> Ticor </span> </em> <span __num="233" __label="true"> and </span> <em> <span __num="234" __label="true"> U-Haul </span> </em> <span __num="235" __label="true"> . The Transition Report prepared by the ABA Antitrust Section stated that the state action exemption still presents concerns from a competition policy standpoint. </span> <a href="#N_38_"> <sup> <span __num="236"> (38) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="237" __label="true"> The Report recommended a reexamination of the scope of the exemption. We are doing that. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="238" __label="true"> C. Monopolization </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="239" __label="true"> Some of you may be wondering what my position will be on monopolization cases. Again, it is the stubborn facts that count most. Where we can show that exclusionary conduct reasonably appears capable of making a significant contribution to creating or maintaining monopoly power, we will not hesitate to act. </span> <a href="#N_39_"> <sup> <span __num="240"> (39) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="241" __label="true"> The strong appellate decision in </span> <em> <span __num="242" __label="true"> Microsoft </span> </em> <span __num="243" __label="true"> re-confirms that improper conduct by firms with monopoly power can give rise to substantial antitrust issues. The Commission will not back away from these types of cases, but they must be economically and factually sound. For example, in the </span> <em> <span __num="244" __label="true"> U-Haul </span> </em> <span __num="245" __label="true"> case that we brought in 1985, the complaint alleged that U-Haul and its parent AMERCO attempted to monopolize the market for rental moving equipment by engaging in a series of anticompetitive acts against a competitor in a Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding, Jartran, and that the respondents " </span> <em> <span __num="246" __label="true"> in fact </span> </em> <span __num="247" __label="true"> injured competition by jeopardizing and substantially delaying Jartran's emergence as a reorganized company, capable of resuming its role as an effective competitor." </span> <a href="#N_40_"> <sup> <span __num="248"> (40) </span> </sup> </a> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="249" __label="true"> D. Process Issues </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="250" __label="true"> We have always had a problem at the FTC with the speed and efficiency of non-HSR investigations. Unlike HSR, we do not have a statutory clock that pushes such cases. I have directed Joe Simons to develop and implement new procedures and controls. We want our non-merger enforcement activities to be "timely, likely and efficient." </span> </p> <p align="center"> <strong> <span __num="251" __label="true"> V. Non-Enforcement Initiatives </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="252" __label="true"> One of the best innovations of the Pitofsky Commission was to be active in holding public hearings and workshops on substantial consumer protection and competition-related issues affecting the American economy. These proceedings help us develop a better understanding of new economic and business developments, and their consumer-related implications, in a non-adversarial process, and are useful to the Commission, the Congress, and others, by informing policy and possibly future enforcement decisions. We have already continued the practice of sponsoring these proceedings with our just concluded conference on Gasoline Prices last week. </span> <a href="#N_41_"> <sup> <span __num="253"> (41) </span> </sup> </a> <span __num="254" __label="true"> There will be follow-up hearings on this issue over the next several months, and we will have similar hearings on other antitrust and consumer protection issues over the next few years. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="255" __label="true"> The FTC also has a long and distinguished history of being an advocate for competition and consumers in connection with federal, state, and local regulation. This is called our "Advocacy Program." We will be selective in choosing where to intervene - our resources do not permit us to be everywhere, nor would that make sense - but we will be active. In a related vein, we will look for suitable opportunities to be a competition policy advocate as an </span> <em> <span __num="256" __label="true"> amicus curiae </span> </em> <span __num="257" __label="true"> in private litigation. Those cases will be limited to situations where we can make a contribution on important legal issues. </span> </p> <p align="center"> <strong> <span __num="258" __label="true"> Conclusion </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="259" __label="true"> Protecting consumers is the purpose of the antitrust laws and the mission of the Federal Trade Commission. I fully support our mission and a vigorous pro-consumer antitrust enforcement agenda. The "stubborn facts" of our actions will not support the preconceptions of some that we are here to put the brakes on antitrust. I look forward to working with the ABA to ensure that our antitrust enforcement is the best it can be to protect American consumers. </span> </p> <p> <small> <strong> <span __num="260" __label="true"> Endnotes: </span> </strong> </small> </p> <p> <small> <a name="N_1_"> <span __num="261"> 1. </span> </a> <span __num="262" __label="true"> Timothy J.
