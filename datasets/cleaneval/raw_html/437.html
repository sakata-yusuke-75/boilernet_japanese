Milford Central School </span> </i> </a> <span __num="13" __label="true"> portend for other church-state relationships, including school voucher programs and President Bush's </span> <a href="/templates/document.asp?documentID=14103"> <span __num="14" __label="true"> charitable-choice initiative </span> </a> <span __num="15" __label="true"> that would increase the involvement of religious groups in the delivery of public services? </span> </p> <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> There was considerable disagreement on that point in the wake of the high court ruling, which continues the court's recent trend of viewing student religious activities as a form of protected free expression rather than as an establishment of religion. Using the language of free-speech cases, the court said the school district engaged in unconstitutional "viewpoint discrimination" when it barred the Good News Club from meeting after school in an elementary school cafeteria. The meetings were aimed at exposing children age six through 12 to Christian Bible teachings. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="17" __label="true"> Pepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec, incoming dean of Catholic University's law school, said the ruling's emphasis on equal treatment of religious and nonreligious organizations by government would boost the Bush initiative. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="18" __label="true"> "President Bush's proposal is not to single out the religious groups for favoritism, but to include them as additional options or resources addressing everything from job training to mental health counseling to substance abuse treatment," said Kmiec. "The court has signaled by this opinion that there is little to no legal objection to his doing so." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="19" __label="true"> Kmiec also said the decision would be an encouragement for voucher programs that include parochial schools. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> But University of Texas law professor Douglas Laycock, also an expert on church-state legal doctrine, said yesterday's ruling would have no impact on charitable choice or vouchers. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="21" __label="true"> "Financial aid cases and speech cases are still viewed differently by the court," Laycock said. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy — both in the majority yesterday — are generally more skeptical when government is giving money, rather than access, to religious organizations. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="22" __label="true"> The most immediate effect of the decision will be felt at public schools, which may have a harder time arguing that a group's meetings are "too religious" to be held on school premises. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> The ruling appears to erase a line that several appeals courts had drawn between permissible clubs that discuss social issues from a religious perspective and organizations that can be barred because they are too much like worship services or are aimed at converting students. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="24" __label="true"> "We disagree that something that is 'quintessentially religious' or 'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development," wrote Justice Clarence Thomas for the majority. "We can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="25" __label="true"> School officials say the ruling will make it difficult for them to prohibit the use of school facilities for any kind of religious purpose — including Sabbath worship services, which are already permitted in many districts, especially in the South. One unappealing choice for schools would be to prohibit all after-school meetings, including religious ones, thereby giving equal treatment to all. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> (The Associated Press reported today that school officials in Milford were weighing two options in response to yesterday's ruling: barring all groups from meeting there or pushing starting times back for all clubs until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., a few hours after students are dismissed. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> The Rev. Stephen Fournier, organizer of the Good News Club, said the second choice wouldn't work because the group wants to meet directly after school so it can reach the most students. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="28" __label="true"> "That rules out the club meeting at the school," said Fournier, pastor of Milford Community Bible Church. "The best opportunity for us to reach the kids was right after school." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="29" __label="true"> Superintendent Peter Livshin told the AP the school board planned to meet June 14 to begin talking about a new policy and would have new rules in place before the beginning of the next school year.) </span> </p> <p> <span __num="30" __label="true"> Meanwhile, in dissent yesterday, Justice David Souter expressed fear that the high court's ruling could stand for "the remarkable proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must be opened for use as a church, synagogue or mosque." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="31" __label="true"> Souter also said, "It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of Christian conversion." Thomas's majority opinion said Souter's description of the club's activities was accurate. Joining Souter's dissent were Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="32" __label="true"> The ruling also appeared to break new ground in the court's analysis of the perceptions of elementary school children. Traditionally, in speech as well as religion cases, the court has said that the younger the audience, the more impressionable it is — and therefore, the easier it is for government to restrict the message the children are receiving. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="33" __label="true"> In the case decided yesterday, Milford officials had argued that elementary-age children would gain the impression that the state was endorsing religion if they saw the club convening at school, even after classes are over. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="34" __label="true"> But Justice Thomas's majority opinion dismissed that argument. Thomas asserted that parents, who must give permission for their children to attend the meetings, would not be confused about whether the school system was endorsing religion. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="35" __label="true"> As for the perceptions of the children themselves, Thomas said, "We cannot say the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the public forum." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> Critics of the decision decried the court's new approach on this issue. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="37" __label="true"> "This decision ignores the practical reality that students will perceive the school's endorsement of the religious worship when it is conducted on elementary school premises," said Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National School Boards Association. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="38" __label="true"> Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agreed. "In the minds of impressionable young students, today's decision is likely to blur the line between public school and Sunday school," he said. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="39" __label="true"> The decision reaffirmed two earlier Supreme Court rulings: </span> <a href="/fac/92-93/lambs93.htm"> <i> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District </span> </i> </a> <span __num="41" __label="true"> in 1993 and </span> <a href="/fac/94-95/Uva95.htm"> <i> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of University of Virginia </span> </i> </a> <span __num="43" __label="true"> in 1995. Both opinions call for equal treatment of religious viewpoints in public forums. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> But several organizations that favor greater separation of church and state were upset that the court majority saw no difference between the religious meetings in </span> <i> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Lamb's Chapel </span> </i> <span __num="46" __label="true"> and those sponsored by the Good News Club. In </span> <i> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Lamb's Chapel, </span> </i> <span __num="48" __label="true"> the organization sought to show a film series on school premises that discussed secular social and family issues from a religious viewpoint. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="49" __label="true"> "In glossing over the vast factual distinctions between the Good News Club and the court's ruling in Lamb's Chapel," said the American Jewish Committee, "the court applied existing principles of law in a way that defies common sense." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> But the decision drew cheers from groups that have sought equal treatment for religious viewpoints in public forums. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> "The court reaffirmed that government should act with benevolent neutrality toward religion and not with malevolent hostility," said Jan LaRue of the Family Research Council. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> "The Supreme Court decision represents an important victory for the First Amendment and sends a powerful message that religious organizations must receive equal treatment," said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, who argued the </span> <i> <span __num="53" __label="true"> Lamb's Chapel </span> </i> <span __num="54" __label="true"> case.
