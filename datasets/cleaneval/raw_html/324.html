    <p> <span __num="3" __label="true"> The adjective "aromatic" is used by organic chemists in a rather different way than it is normally applied. It has its origin in the observation that certain natural substances, such as cinnamon bark, wintergreen leaves, vanilla beans and anise seeds, contained fragrant compounds having common but unexpected properties. Cinnamon bark, for example, yielded a pleasant smelling compound, formula C </span> <sub> <span __num="4"> 9 </span> </sub> <span __num="5"> H </span> <sub> <span __num="6"> 8 </span> </sub> <span __num="7" __label="true"> O, named cinnamaldehyde. Because of the low hydrogen to carbon ratio in this and other aromatic compounds (note that the H:C ratio in an alkane is &gt;2), chemists expected their structural formulas would contain a large number of double or triple bonds. Since double bonds are easily cleaved by oxidative reagents such as potassium permanganate or ozone, and rapidly add bromine and chlorine, these reactions were applied to these aromatic compounds. Surprisingly, products that appeared to retain many of the double bonds were obtained, and these compounds exhibited a high degree of chemical stability compared with known alkenes and cycloalkenes ( </span> <a href="nomen1.htm#nom1"> <span __num="8" __label="true"> aliphatic compounds </span> </a> <span __num="9" __label="true"> ).

For comparison, reactions of cyclohexene, a typical alkene, with these reagents are also shown (green box).

This further confirms the previous indication that the six-carbon benzene core is unusually stable to chemical modification. The conceptual contradiction presented by a high degree of unsaturation (low H:C ratio) and high chemical stability for benzene and related compounds remained an unsolved puzzle for many years.

    <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> Here, two structurally and energetically equivalent electronic structures for a stable compound are written, but no single structure provides an accurate or even an adequate representation of the true molecule. The six-membered ring in benzene is a perfect hexagon (all carbon-carbon bonds have an identical length of 1.40 Å). The cyclohexatriene contributors would be expected to show alternating bond lengths, the double bonds being shorter (1.34 Å) than the single bonds (1.54 Å). An alternative representation for benzene (circle within a hexagon) emphasizes the pi-electron delocalization in this molecule, and has the advantage of being a single diagram. In cases such as these, the electron delocalization described by resonance enhances the stability of the molecules, and compounds composed of such molecules often show exceptional stability and related properties. </span> </p>

    <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Evidence for the enhanced thermodynamic stability of benzene was obtained from measurements of the heat released when double bonds in a six-carbon ring are hydrogenated (hydrogen is added catalytically) to give cyclohexane as a common product. In the following diagram cyclohexane represents a low-energy reference point. Addition of hydrogen to cyclohexene produces cyclohexane and releases heat amounting to 28.6 kcal per mole. If we take this value to represent the energy cost of introducing one double bond into a six-carbon ring, we would expect a cyclohexadiene to release 57.2 kcal per mole on complete hydrogenation, and 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene to release 85.8 kcal per mole. These </span> <b> <span __num="28" __label="true"> heats of hydrogenation </span> </b> <span __num="29" __label="true"> would reflect the relative thermodynamic stability of the compounds.

The nucleophilicities cited above were obtained from reactions in methanol solution. Polar, protic solvents such as water and alcohols solvate anions by hydrogen bonding interactions, as shown in the diagram on the right. These solvated species are more stable and less reactive than the unsolvated "naked" anions. Polar, aprotic solvents such as DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), DMF (dimethylformamide) and acetonitrile do not solvate anions nearly as well as methanol, but provide good solvation of the accompanying cations. Consequently, most of the nucleophiles discussed here react more rapidly in solutions prepared from these solvents. These solvent effects are more pronounced for small basic anions than for large weakly basic anions. Thus, for reaction in DMSO solution we observe the following reactivity order: </span> </p>

    <p> <span __num="390" __label="true"> As we have noted, many common organic reactions proceed by bonding between nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in the reactant molecules. Three examples are shown in equations 1 through 3; electrophiles are colored red, and nucleophiles are colored blue. </span> </p> 
    <p align="center"> <img src="Images/react11.gif"> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="391" __label="true"> Reaction #1 is an example of a S </span> <sub> <span __num="392"> N </span> </sub> <span __num="393" __label="true"> 2 substitutionreaction. The electrophilic carbon of 1-chlorobutane is attackedby the nucleophilic bromide anion in a single-step displacementprocess. The curly brackets enclose a structure for the transitionstate in this reaction. </span> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="394" __label="true"> Reactions #2 and #3 are two-step sequences. In the former addition reaction,bromine (an electrophile) attacks the nucleophilic double bondof 1-butene to give an electrophilic cyclic-bromonium intermediate (enclosedin square brackets) accompanied by a nucleophilic bromide ion. This ion-pair is very short-lived, another nucleophile-electrophilebonding reaction leads to the product (1,2-dibromobutane). Inreaction #3 (a substitution reaction) the electrophilic carbonyl carbon atom bonds to thenucleophilic oxygen atom of ethyl alcohol to give an intermediate (insquare brackets) that eliminates HCl, yielding the ester ethyl acetate. Inall of these examples the reactivity of the electrophiles andnucleophiles is sufficient to allow reaction to proceed spontaneouslyat room temperature. </span> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="395" __label="true"> It is not difficult, however, to find very similar combinations of compounds that either fail to react at all, or do so extremely slowly. Equations 4 through 6 illustrate this behavior for analogs of the first three reactions. </span> </p> 
    <p align="center"> <img src="Images/react12.gif"> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="396" __label="true"> The factors that influence such differences in reactivity may be complex, but in the above cases are largely due to a poor anionic leaving group (eq. 4); aromatic stabilization and reduced nucleophilicity of a conjugated ?-electron system (eq. 5); and reduced electrophilic character of a substituted carbonyl group (eq. 6). </span> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="397" __label="true"> First, compare reaction #4 with #1. Since oxygen is slightlymore electronegative than chlorine (3.5 vs. 2.8 on the Pauling scale), we might expecta C-O bond to be more polar than a C-Cl bond. A bettermeasure of the electrophilic character of a carbon atom in a compoundcomes from nmr chemical shifts (both </span> <sup> <span __num="398"> 1 </span> </sup> <span __num="399"> H &amp; </span> <sup> <span __num="400" __label="true"> 13 </span> </sup> <span __num="401" __label="true"> C), and these indicate that oxygen and chlorinesubstituents exert similar effects when bonded to sp </span> <sup> <span __num="402" __label="true"> 3 </span> </sup> <span __num="403" __label="true"> hybridized carbon atoms. In any event, the failure ofreaction #4 cannot be due to differences in the electrophilicityand nucleophilicity of the reactants. </span> <br> <span __num="404" __label="true"> The key factor here is the stability of the leaving anion (chloridevs. hydroxide). We know that HCl is a much stronger acid thanwater (by more than 15 powers of ten), and this difference willbe reflected in reactions that generate their conjugate bases. Thus, chloride anion is much more stable and less reactive than is hydroxide anion, so the former is a better and more common leaving group. Indeed,the failure of alcohols to undergo S </span> <sub> <span __num="405"> N </span> </sub> <span __num="406" __label="true"> 2 substitutionreactions makes them useful solvents for many such reactions, including #1. </span> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="407" __label="true"> In the case of reaction #5, the aromatic stabilization of the benzenering makes it less susceptible to attack by electrophiles thanare simple alkenes. Thus, elemental bromine is not sufficientlyelectrophilic to induce a reaction with benzene, even though thelatter is nucleophilic. </span> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="408" __label="true"> Lastly, reactions #3 and #6 illustrate differences in the reactivity ofcarbonyl compounds. We know that the carbon atom of a carbonylgroup is electrophilic and undergoes reaction with a variety ofnucleophiles. However, this electrophilic character may be enhancedor diminished by substituents. If we take saturated aldehydes (RCH=O) as a reference, the additional alkyl substituent present in ketonesslightly reduces this electrophilicity, but the general reactivitypattern of these classes is similar. On the other hand, a chlorinesubstituent is inductively electron withdrawing and increasesthe electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon significantly. Thus,acid chlorides are very reactive with a wide range of nucleophiles,including water and alcohols (eq. 3). </span> <br> <span __num="409" __label="true"> The oxygen and nitrogen substituents present in esters and amideshave a similar inductive effect, but also a pronounced electrondonating character through a resonance interaction. Consequently, the carbonyl carbon atom becomes less electrophilic, and these functional groups are less reactive than other carbonylcompounds. Thus, the failure of ethyl acetateto react with water (eq. 6) reflects the reduced electrophilic character of its carbonyl group. </span> </p> 
    <p> <span __num="410" __label="true"> Fortunately, these retarding factors can often be overcome by acid or base catalysis, which in general enhances electrophilicity (acids) or nucleophilicity (bases). Equations 7 through 9 show how this tactic may be effectively applied to the unreactive examples given above. </span> </p>
