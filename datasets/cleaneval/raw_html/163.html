   <h3> <a name="1"> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Introduction </span> </a> </h3> 
   <span __num="57" __label="true"> Many books and articles have been written arguing that someone other thanWilliam Shakespeare, the glover's son from Stratford-upon-Avon, wrote theplays and poems published under his name. There exist sincere andintelligent people who believe there is strong evidence that Edward deVere, Seventeenth Earl of Oxford, was the author of these plays and poems.Yet professional Shakespeare scholars -- those whose job it is to study,write, and teach about Shakespeare -- generally find Oxfordianclaims to be groundless, often not even worth discussing. </span> 
   <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Why is this? Oxfordians claim that these scholars are blinded to theevidence by a vested self-interest in preserving the authorship of "theStratford Man," and some more extreme Oxfordians claim that there is anactive conspiracy among orthodox scholars to suppress pro-Oxford evidenceand keep it from the attention of the general public. The truth, however,is far more prosaic. Oxfordians are not taken seriously by theShakespeare establishment because (with few exceptions) they do not followbasic standards of scholarship, and the "evidence" they present for theirfantastic scenarios is either distorted, taken out of context, or flat-outfalse. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="59" __label="true"> This web site is for the intelligent nonspecialist who doesn't knowwhat to make of these challenges to Shakespeare's authorship. Oxfordianbooks can be deceptively convincing to a reader who is unaware of therelevant historical background and unused to the rhetorical tricks used byOxfordians. Our aim is to provide context where needed, exposemisinformation passed off by Oxfordians as fact, and in general show thenonspecialist reader why professional Shakespeare scholars have so littleregard for Oxfordian claims. We know from experience that we are notlikely to convince any Oxfordians to change their views, but we hope thatother readers will find something of value here. We will be updating andadding new material as time permits, and we welcome any comments orsuggestions. </span> </p>

   <a name="how"> <span __num="63" __label="true"> Antistratfordians try to seduce their readers into believing that thereis some sort of "mystery" about the authorship of Shakespeare'sworks. They often assert that nothing (or at most very little)connects William Shakespeare of Stratford to the works ofWilliam Shakespeare the author, or that the evidence which exists is "circumstantial"and subject to some doubt. These are astounding misrepresentationsthat bear little resemblance to reality. Indeed, abundant evidence testifies tothe fact that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the works publishedunder his name, and this evidence is as extensive and direct as the evidencefor virtually any of Shakespeare's contemporaries.

They are informal in tone, but I tried to make them as accurate andfactual as possible. The next two essays were written later, as parts oflonger essays in progress on Shakespeare's death and education. The last essay was written in response to Mark Alexander, one of the Oxfordianregulars on the newsgroup. Mark has always been a highly articulate and intelligentopponent, and he has often forced me to think through my own positions more thoroughly than I wouldotherwise have done. In this post, I address some of the broader issues involved in theShakespeare authorship debate, and try to articulate the major reasons why I find the Oxfordianapproach fundamentally flawed. </span>

   <span __num="130" __label="true"> The most obvious evidence that William Shakespeare wrote the worksattributed to him is that everyone at the time said he did: he was oftenpraised in writing as a poet and playwright, he was named as the author ofmany of the works while he was alive, and seven years after his death theFirst Folio explicitly attributed the rest of the works to him. Oxfordians try to account for this evidence by claiming that the man fromStratford was actually "William Shaksper" (or "Shakspere"), a man whosename was spelled and pronounced differently from that of the great poet"William Shakespeare," and that nobody at the time would have thought toconfuse the two.

To those who are familiar withElizabethan society in general, and with William Shakespeare's life inparticular, neither of these assumptions comes close to holding water. In thissection we present two pairs of articles, the first pair dealing with thearistocrat/class issue, the second dealing with the education issue. </span>

He points out that nobody inShakespeare's day or for centuries afterward thought that the plays displayed anaccurate knowledge of royal courts (in fact, the opposite was the case), andthat modern social historians familiar with 16th-century court life have cometo a similar conclusion. </span>

Oxfordians like to ridicule this veryreasonable inference; where, they ask, could Shakespeare have gotten the bookshe would have had to read? But in fact, Shakespeare was particularlywell-positioned in this regard. Richard Field, who grew up down the streetfrom Shakespeare and in very similar circumstances, became one of the leadingpublishers and booksellers in London. More importantly, he published many ofthe works his townsman Shakespeare relied on most heavily in composing hisplays.
