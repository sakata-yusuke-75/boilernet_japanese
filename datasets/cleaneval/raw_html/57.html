         <blockquote> 
          <span __num="5" __label="true"> About your column of today, I can tell you, privately, that the view of Syria expressed in the news article you cite is not widely shared among US analysts of the ME. It may reflect a political decision by the administration to marginalize Bashar, but the idea that he is viewed as living on borrowed time is not held at the level of working analysts. </span>

         <br> 
         <span __num="8" __label="true"> (Thanks to Timur Goksel of AUB for sending this to me. Anyone who thinks the Syrian regime is on the verge of collapse hasn't been in Syria for some time. Interesting for the spin though. There is no organized opposition in Syria. Notions that President Asad is not in the loop seem silly to me. Certainly, he is not the only power in Syria, to which he alludes when he claims not to be a dictator, but that is far from suggesting that he is not the principal power.) </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <blockquote> 
          <span __num="9" __label="true"> The US administration believes that the Alawite regime in Syria is on the verge of collapse, and that SyrianPresident Bashar Assad will not survive for long after the pullout of Syrian forces from Lebanon is completed-this was indicated by talks held by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in Washington this week. </span> 
          <br> 
          <br> 
          <span __num="10" __label="true"> This assessment, which was originally reached by the CIA, is sharedby all leading government officials, ranging from President George Bushand Vice President Dick Cheney, to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other officials. </span> 
          <br> 
          <br> 
          <span __num="11" __label="true"> The talks indicate that the Americans have written off President Assad; as far as they are concerned he does not exist, and they are already looking ahead and planning the day after the fall of the Syrian regime and the end of the Alawite minority rule in Damascus. </span> 
          <br> 
          <br> 
          <span __num="12" __label="true"> From the American viewpoint, Bashar Assad has in fact taken over the dubious position left open by Yasser Arafat, and is now disqualified andwritten off in precisely the manner that the Americans wrote off Arafat before him. The reasons for this are varied: the Syrian double game with regard to terrorism, the role that the Syrians are playing in Iraq, the Syrian conduct in Lebanon and the general Syrian functioning vis-a-vis the US administration. </span> 
          <br> 
          <br> 
          <span __num="13" __label="true"> In closed conversations, the Americans, including President Bush, say that Assad is a "peculiar fellow" who cannot be counted on, hopes cannot be pinned on him, and [the US] should wait until he disappears from the political scene. The administration believes that the Syrian people are ripe to begin a democratic process. "In Syria too, people are aware of what is happening around the world and in the region," say the Americans. On the other hand, officials in Washington express grave concern with regard to what is expected in Lebanon. It is feared that </span> 
          <br> 
          <span __num="14" __label="true"> following the Syrian pullout and the beginning of the democratic process, Lebanon will undergo an internal collapse due to the high level of internal ethnic tension in the country. </span>

         <span __num="17" __label="true"> : Brussels links Euro-med accord with damascus' politics in lebanon," writes Will Rasmussen of the Daily Star, April 08, 2005. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="18" __label="true"> The EU finally broke cover this week in announcing it will not sign a billion-dollar trade pact with Syria until key European demands on Lebanon are met. The EU has insisted on a full withdrawal from Lebanon and parliamentary elections without interference from Syria. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="19" __label="true"> Without the deal, the Syrian economy will lose an important lifeline, but more importantly, the EU's decision signals that the international isolation of the Syrian government will increase. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="20" __label="true"> Syria had hoped that signing the agreement, which gives Damascus greater access to EU markets, would drive a wedge between Europe and America. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="21" __label="true"> Demanding that Syria tighten its borders with Iraq and stop supporting anti-Israel groups such as Hizbullah, the U.S. has imposed a raft of sanctions on Damascus, which does not mean much economically, but puts a political squeeze on Syrian President Bashar Assad. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="22" __label="true"> Europe, though, continued to pursue a different strategy of engagement with Syria, even initialing the trade pact last October - a month after Resolution 1559 was passed. The association agreement involves billions of dollars of aid to Damascus as well as the creation of an EU-Syrian free trade zone. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="23" __label="true"> But finally, the EU seems to have lost patience, as The Daily Star first predicted last month. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="24" __label="true"> Frank Hesske, EU ambassador to Syria, said this week: "I don't see how we could consider a signature earlier than ... fulfillment of these two conditions: full, verifiable withdrawal of troops and intelligence services and the issue of what we really see on the ground, free, transparent elections or not." </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="25" __label="true"> The deal is still in administrative limbo, awaiting translation of its 1,500 pages into EU languages. It must be unanimously passed by all 25 EU members and could be signed at the earliest by June. Syria has a positive trade balance with the EU of about $1 billion, largely due to its petroleum exports, but its economy is suffering from a negative growth rate and high unemployment. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="26" __label="true"> When The Daily Star first queried European officials last month, they hinted that signing the agreement would be contingent on whether Syria withdraws its troops from Lebanon. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="27" __label="true"> But the Europeans are expanding their scope and toughening their line against Damascus. Now, they're insisting on a second condition: that Syria respects free and transparent elections in Lebanon, which the Lebanese opposition is already accusing the Syrian-backed Karami government of delaying. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="28" __label="true"> Last week, the EU enraged Damascus by inviting Syrian opposition leader Farid Ghadry, who recently met top U.S. State Department officials in Washington, to Brussels to argue his case for why the agreement should be delayed. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="29" __label="true"> Ghadry, who heads the Reform Party of Syria, said the treaty shouldn't be ratified until Syria improves its human rights record and introduces democratic reforms. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="30" __label="true"> According to Ghadry, the trade agreement is a key opportunity to pressure Damascus, which is the only country in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership - which brings together 25 EU countries and their 12 Mediterranean neighbors - not to sign an agreement. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="31" __label="true"> "The regime of Assad is desperate to sign the agreement because it shows that it can isolate the Europeans from the Americans," Ghadry told The Daily Star. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="32" __label="true"> Ghadry said: "Not only will it give Syria an economic boost that we think will again only benefit the elite but it will also give the regime a political boost, something the Reform Party of Syria does not want at this time. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="33" __label="true"> "The EU trade with Syria represents approximately 40 percent of Syria's GDP, so it's very important for them." </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="34" __label="true"> Ghadry urged the EU to leverage the trade agreement not just to free Lebanon from Assad's grip but to improve its human rights record. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="35" __label="true"> "The only reform possible is the lifting of the emergency laws, release of all prisoners, changing the Constitution to accept all political parties and dismantling the intelligence services," said Ghadry. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="36" __label="true"> "If these are done, then we can start a meaningful dialogue to transition the country into a full-fledged democracy." </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="37" __label="true"> Ghadry's demands are further than the EU has signaled it is willing to push. It doesn't seem likely, though, that the agreement will be signed before June, when the EU presidency changes hands and new political priorities could come into play. </span> 
         <br> 
         <br> 
         <span __num="38" __label="true"> Until then, Syria's pariah status will continue, unless, of course, it shows a willingness to cooperate fully in Lebanon. </span>

I was disappointed when you posted news article that I have read days ago! I really like to hear what the PEOPLE IN SYRIA (government, politicians, economists and ordinary people) are thinking! </span> <br> <br> <span __num="86" __label="true"> I agree with â€œAnonymous At 7:29 PMâ€? that due to the eradication and threat policy against Syrian politicians there is no organized opposition. Don't be deceived that there is no opposition. It smells like what happened to Saddam when he surrounded himself with â€œyes sirâ€? men who lied to him just to either get rewarded with money and power or to be protected from his oppression. Assad, Jr. is surrounded by the same type men who are lying to him by telling him â€œevery Syrian and Lebanese loves you!â€? It is typical of dictators to have that kind of people around them to make them feel good about themselves! My advice to Assad, Jr. is to do his best to allow the Syrians to express themselves freely. One more analogy, the Japanese car makers in the late 1970s allowed their employees to provide opinions and suggestions about how to design and build cars. In few years, they improved the quality of their cars and lowered its cost which led them to control the US auto market! The big three companies in Detroit refused to change and their share of the US auto market plummeted! Look around you, read history and learn from it Dr. Assad before YOU become history! </span> </p>

The Syrian regime most likely will become a hostage to France and the US, and will try to accommodate them for a while to insure its own safety. But it must be said that the regime still have many cards to play. It may bleed but it is not down and out. The President will take steps reform and become more democratic than most states in the region and he may have to take a lot of eternal pain to achieve that. When the Americans wont be satisfied as expected, then the Syrians can and will unleash hill on the head of the Americans in Iraq and may even open the Golan front which can attract plenty of Arab and Moslem help. </span> </p>

Although i agree with most of what you said, your equating the Palestinian and Syrian opposition to each other is stupid. The Syrian opposition wouldn't be trying to start a state within a state in Lebanon as the Palis did. Don't kid yourself, Syrians already have a much larger country than the Lebanese, they don't need a state in Lebanon. Not to mention Lebanon's population density is off the charts and the southern Lebanese are having more children every day. </span> </p>

Its a shame however that your sons will probably go work in the gulf as waiters or salespeople on the floor. Now thats a waste of a mind that could have been used to benefit all the arab states. Engineer, business person, economist, mathematician? Simply a salesman in the gulf. What a pity... </span> </p>

          <p> <span __num="203" __label="true"> We in Lebanon are very disappointed that the EU did not include a conditional clause concerning human rights and the fate of the Lebanese detainees in syria in particular, for the conclusion of the syrian EU agreement. The EU constitution blabs endlessly about human rights and yet, when it comes to practice, it is conveniently oblivious to the atrocities committed by many middle eastern regimes, assad's being on top of the list. Sadly, this matter often finds little support about the people of the middle east themselves, either out of ignorance or out of plain indifference to a phenomenon they have come to view as collateral damage to the regimes in power. I would like to turn the attention of syrian citizens to the plight of teh lEbanese mothers and spouses whose sons have been the victim of forced disappearance by the assad regime for the last 25 years or so. The lucky ones get to see their sons once in a blue moon after significant bribes are paid to various syrian officers. Others cannot even find out if their sons are still alive. Of course we are aware that syrian citizens themselves are also victimized by the assad regime but we rarely hear a voice of support or concern.. </span> </p>
