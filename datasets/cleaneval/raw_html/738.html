        <p> <span __num="34" __label="true"> The Dean campaign has put together a section of their site (" </span> <a href="http://www.blogforamerica.com/bloggerstorm.html"> <span __num="35" __label="true"> Bloggerstorm </span> </a> <span __num="36" __label="true"> ") which has RSS feeds from people with blogs who are on the ground in Iowa.

        <h2 class="date"> <a name="002432"> </a> <span __num="41"> (January 17, 2004 -- 07:06 PM EDT // </span> <i> <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/002432.php"> <span __num="42"> link </span> </a> </i> <span __num="43"> ) </span> </h2> 
        <p> <span class="smallcaps"> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Kevin Drum has </span> </span> <span __num="45" __label="true"> the most concise, on-point </span> <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003058.html"> <span __num="46" __label="true"> run-down </span> </a> <span __num="47" __label="true"> on the Clark </span> <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/clark.perle.testimony.pdf"> <span __num="48" __label="true"> testimony </span> </a> <span __num="49" __label="true"> silliness. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> As Drum says, "The nickel version is that Clark testified before Congress in 2002 that Saddam was a dangerous guy and it was appropriate to put a lot pressure on him. Then after the war was over he wrote an op-ed for the London Times congratulating everyone involved for having fought a brilliant campaign." </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> The issue here is what it means to be 'anti-war'. I've said I suppose a million times now that Clark was a consistent opponent of the president's policy. But I've also said that calling him 'anti-war' misses the mark. I say this because in our politics this phrase 'anti-war' has a meaning that goes beyond one's position on a given use of military force. It signals a general tone -- one that simply doesn't apply to Clark and leads to all sorts of innocent and in other cases not so innocent misunderstandings. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> So for instance this </span> <a href="http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/011704/opi_14563058.shtml"> <span __num="53" __label="true"> very anti-Clark editorial </span> </a> <span __num="54" __label="true"> in the </span> <i> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Florida Times-Union </span> </i> <span __num="56" __label="true"> says Clark now has no credibility because his congressional testimony "hardly sound[s] like the words of a war protester." </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="57" __label="true"> A 'war-protestor'. You get the idea where this goes. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Similarly, Mickey Kaus </span> <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2093760/"> <span __num="59" __label="true"> says </span> </a> <span __num="60" __label="true"> "it's impossible to square this </span> <i> <span __num="61" __label="true"> London Times </span> </i> <span __num="62" __label="true"> article with Clark's current antiwar criticism. Not only is the tone the opposite of Bush-bashing, but Clark seems to have forgotten that it was "the wrong war at the wrong time," as his adviser Jamie Rubin characterizes his current position." </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="63" __label="true"> This is priceless on a couple levels. Apparently, if a pundit decides you're a 'bush-basher' and then finds you've said something generous about the president, it means you've been untrue to your bush-bashing values. I don't know quite what to make of that. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="64" __label="true"> More to the point, though, I think we've got a more muted version of the </span> <i> <span __num="65" __label="true"> Times-Union's </span> </i> <span __num="66" __label="true"> 'war protestor' line here. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="67" __label="true"> Mickey's line is that opposition to the president's policy is inconsistent with cheering a stunning military victory once the decision for war has been made. For an ex-General I don't think it's that surprising at all. As I said, Mickey's point is similar to the </span> <i> <span __num="68" __label="true"> Times-Union's </span> </i> <span __num="69" __label="true"> point. Since Clark is running as some sort of war protest candidate how could he enthuse over the success of the military's rapid victory in Iraq? </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="70" __label="true"> But whatever people think of Clark, I don't think most people in this country would find that a contradiction. I do think that will cause Clark some difficulties in the Democratic primaries. But the slices of the electorate that will decide this election will, I think, </span> <i> <span __num="71" __label="true"> share </span> </i> <span __num="72" __label="true"> that ambivalence. </span> <br> </p>

        <p> <span class="smallcaps"> <span __num="77" __label="true"> The Zogby poll </span> </span> <span __num="78" __label="true"> out of Iowa continues to have Dean, Gephardt and Kerry grouped in pretty much a tie ( </span> <a href="http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=783"> <span __num="79" __label="true"> Numbers </span> </a> <span __num="80" __label="true"> : Kerry 23%, Dean 22%, Gephardt 19%, Edwards 18%). But the bigger news is out of ARG's New Hampshire poll ( </span> <a href="http://www.americanresearchgroup.com/nhpoll/demtrack/"> <span __num="81" __label="true"> Numbers </span> </a> <span __num="82" __label="true"> : Dean 28%, Clark 22%, Kerry 18%) Clark remains a half dozen points behind Dean. But look at Kerry -- back at 18%. A week ago he was at 10%. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="83" __label="true"> Now, of course, the precise numbers in these tracking polls are volatile. But trends over time are usually on the mark. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="84" __label="true"> A couple days ago over lunch I was talking to a friend about the Kerry campaign. And I said the big question about Kerry was whether an unexpectedly strong showing in Iowa could whip Kerry back into contention in New Hampshire. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="85" __label="true"> My friend said </span> <i> <span __num="86" __label="true"> no, can't happen </span> </i> <span __num="87" __label="true"> . And though I'd proposed it as the big question, I instantly agreed. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="88" __label="true"> But clearly I shouldn't have. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="89" __label="true"> The reason it seemed improbable (to me at least) that Kerry could surge back in New Hampshire is, paradoxically, precisely because he used to be so far ahead there. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="90" __label="true"> I can see Clark surging there, or perhaps Edwards, or even Gephardt. But that's because their support was never that high. Someone who's left Candidate X and is looking for someone new will probably look for someone ... well, </span> <i> <span __num="91" __label="true"> new </span> </i> <span __num="92" __label="true"> , not someone they were supporting before they moved on to candidate X. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="93" __label="true"> Nice theory. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be true. Kerry is quickly moving back into contention in New Hampshire. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="94" __label="true"> Also on the Kerry front, see this </span> <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=express&amp;s=crowley011604"> <span __num="95" __label="true"> article </span> </a> <span __num="96" __label="true"> in </span> <i> <span __num="97" __label="true"> The New Republic </span> </i> <span __num="98" __label="true"> about Kerry's field organizer Michael Whouley -- who may be playing an important role in the shift. </span> </p>

        <p> <span class="smallcaps"> <span __num="103" __label="true"> A quick note </span> </span> <span __num="104" __label="true"> on some </span> <a href="http://66.246.161.7/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_01_11_dish_archive.html#107422661294188378"> <span __num="105" __label="true"> game-playing </span> </a> <span __num="106" __label="true"> on Andrew Sullivan's site on the Drudge/Clark business. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="107" __label="true"> I don't want to get into all the particulars. But two points stand out to me. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="108" __label="true"> One is that Sullivan doesn't seem bothered by the fact that Drudge not only took the quotes out of context but actually </span> <i> <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_01_11.html#002427"> <span __num="109" __label="true"> reordered </span> </a> </i> <span __num="110" __label="true"> them to change their meaning. Why no concern over that? That seems like a problem. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="111" __label="true"> Then he goes on to tendentiously misconstrue most everything Clark said. His final judgment is that Clark's stance was basically identical to Bush's but that at the key moment he wimped out and got cold feet about the war. He also tosses in the self-justifying canard that the whole issue was one of getting the permission of France. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="112" __label="true"> I'll leave it to you to read the </span> <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/clark.perle.testimony.pdf"> <span __num="113" __label="true"> testimony </span> </a> <span __num="114" __label="true"> or not read it and make your own judgments about what Clark says. My read is that it's pretty clear that Sullivan's readings in several cases are just tendentious misconstruals. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="115" __label="true"> But this really isn't about Clark, who can stand or fall on his own. (Like any candidate he has inconsistencies in his positions over time -- just not the extreme, cartoonish ones that certain operatives keep trying to push.) This is about a bigger question, a more fundamental debate. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="116" __label="true"> To Sullivan and those who share his view, if you believed that Iraq remained a serious and unresolved security question for the United States which had to be confronted, and you didn't support the war that the president chose to fight, that means that you had a failure of nerve (add in here, of course, the standard Munich references.) </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="117" __label="true"> But that's only true if you had an extremely myopic view of the Iraq question and believed that quite literally everything had to give way before it. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="118" __label="true"> That was always a foolish read of the situation, and for some it was a dishonest one too. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="119" __label="true"> For my part, the fundamental issue and the issue of urgency was finding out the status of Iraq's WMD programs. Once we'd done that (and we'd largely done that </span> <i> <span __num="120" __label="true"> before we went to war </span> </i> <span __num="121" __label="true"> , particularly on the nuclear arms front) the question became one of much less urgency -- one which we had to balance against a series of other priorities. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="122" __label="true"> What priorities? Al Qaida, for one -- which the Iraq adventure set back. More importantly, I think, was creating an international order in which American power is durable and enduring. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="123" __label="true"> As Fareed Zakaria (another weak-willed peacenik) </span> <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3068616/"> <span __num="124" __label="true"> wrote about a year ago </span> </a> <span __num="125" __label="true"> , in the process of solving the Iraq problem the administration created an America problem. As he wrote ... </span> </p> 
        <blockquote> 
         <span __num="126" __label="true"> [T]he administration is wrong if it believes that a successful war will make the world snap out of a deep and widening mistrust and resentment of American foreign policy. A war with Iraq, even if successful, might solve the Iraq problem. It doesn’t solve the America problem. What worries people around the world above all else is living in a world shaped and dominated by one country—the United States. And they have come to be deeply suspicious and fearful of us. </span> 
        </blockquote> 
        <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> I think it's pretty clear now that we haven't solved the Iraq problem -- or perhaps we got rid of one Iraq problem and created another. But even if we had solved it, I think the bargain that Zakaria sketches out was a bad one, especially after it'd become quite clear that the threat from Iraq was minimal. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="128" __label="true"> These are complex questions, ones not easily reasoned through by the standard nah-nah-nah. But there are some folks who can't get over their 1939-envy, their hunger for the Orwell moment. But this wasn't one of them. It never was. And the failure to understand that -- whether by deception or myopia or an honest mistake or the simple need for drama that is the curse of intellectuals -- has done us real harm. </span> </p>

        <p> <span __num="145" __label="true"> In a subsequent post last night I quoted a passage from a piece which ran on the </span> <i> <span __num="146" __label="true"> KnightRidder </span> </i> <span __num="147" __label="true"> newswire. Here's the passage ... </span> </p> 
        <blockquote> 
         <span __num="148" __label="true"> Clark's congressional testimony was further distorted Thursday by cyber-gossip columnist Matt Drudge, who quoted selected portions of Clark's testimony and added sentences that don't appear in the transcript on his Web site Thursday. Drudge didn't respond to an e-mail request for comment. </span> 
        </blockquote> 
        <p> <span __num="149" __label="true"> Now, I figured the authors of the piece had done their homework on this one, particularly the point claiming he had "added sentences that don't appear in the transcript." But it seems that that's not quite true. Drudge did something almost as bad, but not quite. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="150" __label="true"> With the help of TPM's crack editorial assistant Zander Dryer we compared the Drudge quotes with the ones in the actual transcript. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="151" __label="true"> By our read, all but one was right there in the text. And we assume the one they're referring to is this one ... </span> </p> 
        <blockquote> 
         <span __num="152" __label="true"> There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat... Yes, he has chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long time. But the United States right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001... He is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we. </span> 
        </blockquote> 
        <p> <span __num="153" __label="true"> As we've reconstructed it, this is where it's from ... </span> </p> 
        <blockquote> 
         <span __num="154" __label="true"> There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat (p. 6)... Yes, he has chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long time. But the United States right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001 (p. 25-26--Clark is actually making the point that this posture gives us time to "work the diplomacy")... he is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we (p. 6). </span> 
        </blockquote> 
        <p> <span __num="155" __label="true"> This is a big no-no. Ellipses (the dot, dot, dots) are one thing. But you don't take ellipses out of their order when the reordering changes the meaning. However, that's still very different from manufacturing quotes. And by our read, that wasn't done. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="156" __label="true"> Now, none of this changes the substance of the original point. This is more a house-keeping post. Drudge and various GOP chat-meisters and CNN anchors who followed his lead, cherry-picked a few quotes out of context and in so doing made Clark's testimony seem almost the exact opposite of what it in fact was. </span> </p>

        <p> <span __num="197" __label="true"> Toward the end of the session Perle himself characterized Clark's position ... </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="198" __label="true"> (Perle's run-down is more than a little disingenuous and he apparently felt the need to wait until Clark had left the hearing room for the day. But let's forgive him this once.) </span> </p> 
        <blockquote> 
         <span __num="199" __label="true"> Schrock: Sure, I would love to know Mr. Perle's, you know, the general said time is on our side. My guess is you do not believe that. </span> 
         <p> <span __num="200" __label="true"> Perle: No, I don't believe it and frankly I don't think [Clark] made a very convincing case in support of that cliche but it was one of many cliches. At the end of the day when you sought to elicit from him a reconciliation of the view that time is on our side with what he acknowledged to be our ignorance of how far along Saddam Hussein is, he had no explanation. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="201" __label="true"> He seems to be preoccupied, and I'm quoting now, with building legitimacy, with exhausting all diplomatic remedies as though we hadn't been through diplomacy for the last decade, and relegating the use of force to a last resort, to building the broadest possible coalition, in short a variety of very amorphous, ephemeral concerns alongside which there's a stark reality and that is that every day that goes by, Saddam Hussein is busy perfecting those weapons of mass destruction that he already has, improving their capabilities, improving the means with which to deliver them and readying himself for a future conflict. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="202" __label="true"> So I don't believe that time is on our side and I don't believe that this fuzzy notion that the most important thing is building legitimacy, as if we lack legitimacy now, after all the U.N. resolutions that he's in blatant violation of, I don't believe that that should be the decisive consideration. So I think General Clark simply doesn't want to see us use military force and he has thrown out as many reasons as he can develop to that but the bottom line is he just doesn't want to take action. He wants to wait. </span> <br> </p>

As nearly as I can tell, this person who worked on his security detail beat his wife. But there's no evidence in the piece that Dean knew it. Then, while this guy was beating his wife or after it had occurred, Dean filed a three page affidavit for use in a custody hearing attesting that the trooper, Dennis Madore, was a good father. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="220" __label="true"> But, again, there's no evidence that Dean knew anything about the abuse!

        <p> <span __num="224" __label="true"> But even in a pint-sized state like Vermont, governors have lots of people who work with them or for them. And they can't be expected to have a handle on what bad acts one or more of them might or might not be doing at home. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="225" __label="true"> It's an impossible standard. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="226" __label="true"> You might say that the piece can't be that unfair since I was able to glean this exculpatory information from it. And to an extent that's true.

        <p> <span __num="227" __label="true"> The article is headlined "Dean's Trooper" -- a pretty obvious reference to the Clinton trooper stories.

        <p> <span __num="289" __label="true"> At a luncheon yesterday in Manhattan (actually at Harold Evans and Tina Brown’s apartment), </span> <i> <span __num="290" __label="true"> The Week </span> </i> <span __num="291" __label="true"> magazine gave out its first annual opinion awards.

So to the editors at </span> <i> <span __num="295" __label="true"> The Week </span> </i> <span __num="296" __label="true"> , to Harold Evans, and to the judges on the panel a very sincere thank you. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="297" __label="true"> There’s a </span> <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2068605"> <span __num="298" __label="true"> write-up </span> </a> <span __num="299" __label="true"> on it at </span> <i> <span __num="300" __label="true"> Editor and Publisher </span> </i> <span __num="301" __label="true"> if you want to find out more. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="302" __label="true"> Now there were various luminaries there and it was quite flattering to hear that some of these people have visited the site. But let me share with you a private moment. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="303" __label="true"> Early on I noticed that one of the folks there was Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="304" __label="true"> Schlesinger, if you’re not familiar with him, is one of those few people who is quite literally a legend in his own time. I don’t know precisely how old he is. But, to give you a sense of the range we’re talking about, the book that made his name as an historian, </span> <i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316773433/talkingpoints-20/ref=nosim"> <span __num="305" __label="true"> The Age of Jackson </span> </a> </i> <span __num="306" __label="true"> , came out, I believe, in 1946. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="307" __label="true"> Schlesinger is an historian and an advisor to president Kennedy, but also a towering figure in 20th century American political life, particularly in the first phase of the Cold War when his name was almost a shorthand for liberal anti-communism and Cold War Liberalism. The key book here is </span> <i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560009896/talkingpoints-20/ref=nosim"> <span __num="308" __label="true"> The Vital Center </span> </a> </i> <span __num="309" __label="true"> , published I believe in 1949 --- a phrase and concept of high moment, before it got cheapened in the 1990s to refer to mere political centrism. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="310" __label="true"> In any case, as you can probably see, Schlesinger is a rather big deal to me. So toward the end of the whole event, after most folks had left, I saw Schlesinger and two women standing off to one side. And I thought, this is my chance. How can I let it go by? </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="311" __label="true"> So I walked over to where the three were talking and planted myself there like a schoolboy and waited. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="312" __label="true"> And I waited, and waited a bit more until they, a touch awkwardly, turned their attention to me. When they did, I introduced myself and told him what a great admirer I was of his and what an honor it was to meet him and so forth. When I did this I explained that in addition to my semi-reputable work as a blogger I was also a trained historian with a Ph.D. in American history and the works. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="313" __label="true"> Now normally I never mention this, or say such things. And I’m half embarrassed to mention to you that I did. But given Schlesinger’s merit in the profession, and my limited window of opportunity to play up my admiration, I thought I’d make an exception for myself in this one case. I probably figured that I’d be making clear that I knew who he was, that my admiration wasn’t just a pleasantry, or perhaps, candidly, that I wasn’t just some yahoo. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="314" __label="true"> To be polite Schlesinger’s wife asked me to explain to them just what a blog is. And though I get this question pretty often, it turns out to be a rather challenging one if the people you’re trying to explain it to don’t necessarily have a lot of clear web reference points to make sense of what you’re saying. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="315" __label="true"> I ended up telling them that it was something like political commentary structured like a personal journal with occasional reporting mixed in. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="316" __label="true"> Now, as I was explaining and watching the looks on everyone’s faces it was incrementally becoming clear to me that this was playing rather like saying that something was like a washing machine structured like a rhinoceros with the occasional sandwich thrown in. And, as Schlesinger himself had said rather little through all this, it was also dawning on me that being one of the four guests of honor at this little event was providing no guarantee against making a bit of a fool of myself. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="317" __label="true"> So we let the brief conversation come to a merciful end and they started to walk away. And, as he was turning to leave, Schlesinger said, “Are you Joshua </span> <i> <span __num="318" __label="true"> Micah </span> </i> <span __num="319"> M ….” </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="320" __label="true"> “Yeah, that's me.” </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="321" __label="true"> “You work for Charlie Peters [i.e., for </span> <i> <span __num="322" __label="true"> The Washington Monthly </span> </i> <span __num="323" __label="true"> ]. I’m an admirer of your journalism.” </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="324" __label="true"> Then they walked away. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="325" __label="true"> My day was made. </span> </p>

        <p> <span __num="371" __label="true"> Rather than get into the particulars, here's the statement Clark delivered, with the portions quoted by Drudge in bold. And you decide whether they accurately capture Clark's meaning and what Clark's testimony actually was. </span> </p> 
        <blockquote> 
         <span __num="372" __label="true"> Thank you, sir. There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat. I was in the joint staff in October of 1994. I think the date was -- I think it was the 8th of October. It was a Thursday morning. The intelligence officer walked in and said, "Sir, you're not going to believe this. Here are the pictures. You can't be believe it. This is the Republican Guard. They're right back in the same attack positions that they occupied four years ago before they invaded Kuwait and here are the two divisions and there are signs of mobilization and concerns north, and we can't understand it." And General Peay was the commander of CENTCOM. Shalikashvili, I think was, visiting Haiti at the time with Secretary of Defense Perry, and we rushed together, we put together a program. General Peay deployed some 15,000 American troops and aircraft over to block it and after a few days, Saddam Hussein recognized what a difficult position he put himself in and withdrew the troops. But, we had not expected it. It was an unanticipated move. It made no sense from our point of view for Saddam Hussein to do this but he did it. It was signaled warning that Saddam Hussein is not only malevolent and violent but he is also to some large degree unpredictable at least to us. </span> 
         <p> <span __num="373" __label="true"> I'm sure he has a rationale for what he's doing, but we don't always know it. He does retain his chemical and biological capabilities to some extend and he is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we. Saddam might use these weapons as a deterrent while launching attacks against Israel or his other neighbors. He might threaten American forces in the region. He might determine that he was the messenger of Allah and simply strike directly at Israel, or Israel weighing the possibilities of blackmail or aggression might feel compelled to strike Iraq first. Now, Saddam has been pursing nuclear weapons and we've been living with this risk for over 20 years. He does not have the weapons now as best we can determine. He might have the weapons in a year or two if the control for the highly-enriched uranium and other fissionable materials broke down. I think his best opportunity would have been to go to his friend Slobodan Milosevic and ask for those materials during the time of the Kosovo campaign, since there was active collusion between the Serbs and the Iraqis, but apparently if he asked for them he didn't get them because the Serbs have turned them over for us. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="374" __label="true"> If he can't get the highly-enriched uranium, then it might take him five years or more to go through a centrifuge process or gaseous diffusion process to enrich the uranium, but the situation is not stable. The U.N. weapons inspectors who, however ineffective they might have been and there's some degree of difference of opinion on that, nevertheless provided assistance in impeding his development programs. They've been absent for four years, and the sanction regime designed to restrict his access to weapons materials and resources has been continuously eroded, and therefore the situation is not stable. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="375" __label="true"> The problem of Iraq is not a problem that can be postponed indefinitely, and of course Saddam's current efforts themselves are violations of international law as expressed in the U.N. resolutions. Our President has emphasized the urgency of eliminating these weapons and weapons programs. I strongly support his efforts to encourage the United Nations to act on this problem and in taking this to the United Nations, the president's clear determination to act if the United States can't -- excuse me, if the United Nations can't provides strong leverage for under girding ongoing diplomatic efforts. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="376" __label="true"> CLARK: But the problem of Iraq is only one element of the broader security challenges facing our country. We have an unfinished worldwide war against Al Qaida, a war that has to be won in conjunction with friends and allies and that ultimately will be won as much by persuasion as by the use of force. We've got to turn off the Al Qaida recruiting machine. Now some 3,000 deaths on September 11th testify to the real danger from Al Qaida, and I think everyone acknowledges that Al Qaida has not yet been defeated. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="377" __label="true"> As far as I know, I haven't seen any substantial evidence linking Saddam's regime to the Al Qaida network, though such evidence may emerge. But nevertheless, winning the war against Al Qaida and taking actions against the weapons programs in Iraq, that's two different problems that may require two different sets of solutions. In other words, to put it back into military parlance, Iraq they're an operational level problem. We've got other operational level problems in the Middle East, like the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Al Qaida and the foundation of radical extremist fundamentalist Islam, that's the strategic problem. We've got to make sure that in addressing the operational problem we're effective in going after the larger strategic problem. And so, the critical issue facing the United States right now is how to force action against Saddam Hussein and his weapons programs without detracting from our focus on Al Qaida or our efforts to deal with other immediate mid and long-term security problems. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="378" __label="true"> I'd like to offer the following observations by way of how we could proceed. First of all, I do believe that the United States diplomacy in the United Nations will be strengthened if the Congress can adopt a resolution expressing U.S. determination to act if the United Nations can not act. The use of force must remain a U.S. option under active consideration. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="379" __label="true"> Such congressional resolution need not, at this point, authorize the use of force. The more focused the resolution on Iraq, the more focused it is on the problems of weapons of mass destruction. The greater its utility in the United Nations, the more nearly unanimous the resolution, the greater its utility is, the greater its impact is on the diplomatic efforts under way. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="380" __label="true"> The president and his national security team have got to deploy imagination, leverage, and patience in working through the United Nations. In the near term, time is on our side and we should endeavor to use the United Nations if at all possible. This may require a period of time for inspections or the development of a more intrusive inspection regime such as Richard Perle has mentioned, if necessary backed by force. It may involve cracking down on the eroding sanctions regime and countries like Syria who are helping Iraq illegally export oil enabling Saddam Hussein to divert resources to his own purposes. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="381" __label="true"> We have to work this problem in a way to gain worldwide legitimacy and understanding for the concerns that we rightly feel and for our leadership. This is what U.S. leadership in the world must be. We must bring others to share our views not be too quick to rush to try to impose them even if we have the power to do so. I agree that there's a risk that the inspections would fail to provide evidence of the weapons program. They might fail, but I think we can deal with this problem as we move along, and I think the difficulties of dealing with this outcome are more than offset by the opportunities to gain allies, support, and legitimacy in the campaign against Saddam Hussein. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="382" __label="true"> If the efforts to resolve the problem by using the United Nations fail, either initially or ultimately, then we need to form the broadest possible coalition including our NATO allies and the North Atlantic Council if we're going to have to bring forces to bear. We should not be using force until the personnel, the organizations, the plans that will be required for post conflict Iraq are prepared and ready. This includes dealing with requirements for humanitarian assistance, police and judicial capabilities, emergency medical and reconstruction assistance and preparations for a transitional governing body and eventual elections, perhaps even including a new constitution. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="383" __label="true"> Ideally, the international/multinational organizations will participate in the readying of such post conflict operations, the United Nations, NATO, other regional organization, Islamic organizations, but we have no idea how long this campaign could last, and if it were to go like the campaign against the Afghans, against the Taliban in which suddenly the Taliban collapsed and there we were. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="384" __label="true"> We need to be ready because if suddenly Saddam Hussein's government collapses and we don't have everything ready to go, we're going to have chaos in that region. We may not get control of all the weapons of mass destruction, technicians, plans, capabilities; in fact, what may happen is that we'll remove a repressive regime and have it replaced with a fundamentalist regime which contributes to the strategic problem rather than helping to solve it. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="385" __label="true"> So, all that having been said, the option to use force must remain on the table. It should be used as the last resort after all diplomatic means have been exhausted unless there's information that indicates that a further delay would represent an immediate risk to the assembled forces and organizations. </span> <b> <span __num="386" __label="true"> And, I want to underscore that I think the United States should not categorize this action as preemptive. Preemptive and that doctrine has nothing whatsoever to do with this problem. As Richard Perle so eloquently pointed out, this is a problem that's longstanding. It's been a decade in the making. It needs to be dealt with and the clock is ticking on this. </span> </b> <span __num="387" __label="true"> Obviously once initiated, a military operation should aim for the most rapid accomplishment of its operational aims and prompt turnover to follow on organizations and agencies, and I think if we proceed as outlined above, we may be able to minimize the disruption to the ongoing campaign against Al Qaida. We could reduce the impact on friendly governments in the region and even contribute to the resolution of other regional issues, perhaps such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iranian efforts to develop nuclear capabilities and Saudi funding for terrorism. But there are no guarantees. The war is unpredictable. It could be difficult and costly and what is at risk in the aftermath is an open-ended American ground commitment in Iraq and an even deeper sense of humiliation in the Arab world which could intensify our problems in the region and elsewhere. </span> </p> 
         <p> <span __num="388" __label="true"> The yellow light is flashing. We have a problem. We've got to muster the best judgment in this country. We've got to muster the will of the American people and we've got to be prepared to deal with this problem, but time is on our side in the near term and we should use it. Thank you. </span> <br> </p>

        <p> <span class="smallcaps"> <span __num="422" __label="true"> Briefly on this </span> </span> <span __num="423" __label="true"> matter of Dean and 'unilateral' action in Bosnia. I'm running late on a few deadlines at the moment. So I don't have time to go into this at length. But I don't think this is much of a contradiction, except possibly on the most superficial level. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="424" __label="true"> The tenor of the whole Iraq debate has tended to make a fetish out of the narrow meaning of unilateral and multilateral. Both have their place. And I don't think it's a contradiction on Dean's part at all to say we should not have waited for NATO to conduct air operations in Bosnia and yet also mount a critique of the president's approach on Iraq. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="425" __label="true"> Remember that in Kosovo, we knew the Russians would veto our plan. So we didn't go to the UN, but went with NATO instead. As Fareed Zakaria aptly </span> <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3068616/"> <span __num="426" __label="true"> noted </span> </a> <span __num="427" __label="true"> almost a year ago, the US never got UN approval for any of its three major military engagements in the 1990s. And few significant players suggested that it was necessary for us to do so. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="428" __label="true"> So why all the hollering now over Iraq? Some on the right suggest that this is because of animosity toward president Bush or a rise in 'anti-Americanism.' But it's not. It's because the US has begun playing by very different rules in the last three years. It has moved from being a dominant power which most often works through a sort of informal consensus to one that increasingly seeks to act through dictation. We've become impatient with the minimal restraints on our power created by our participation in various international institutions and agreements -- ones which actually serve to magnify our power. And nations around the world -- not to mention publics -- have increasingly looked to the UN as a brake on US power. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="429" __label="true"> In short, the issue is not so much whether you get sign off from the UN or NATO on every particular thing you do. It's a question of the totality of one's approach to allies and the rest of the nation's of the world. By that measure, the whole situation in the Balkans and the current one in Iraq could scarcely be more different. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="430" __label="true"> This is a big issue and one that deserves more discussion. It's also worth noting that getting our key European allies on board in the Balkans did play a big role in the long-term success of those operations -- and the diplomatic isolation which eventually played a key role in Milosevic's fall. And perhaps Dean has himself made too much of a fetish out of the word 'unilateralism' without fleshing out the critique more fully. But basically this issue with Dean and 'unilateral' action in Bosnia just strikes me as more silly word-game gotcha. Nothing more than that. </span> </p>

        <p> <span __num="440" __label="true"> I don't think anyone has any really solid clue what's happening. But it does give you a sense of the fluidity of the race -- and not just the Dean-Gephardt contest we've all been focusing on. </span> </p>

         <p> <span __num="469" __label="true"> But what David Kay did discover was they had a weapons program. And had that -that -let me finish for a second. Now it's more extensive than, than missiles. Had that knowledge been examined by the United Nations or had David Kay's report been placed in front of the United Nations, he, Saddam Hussein, would have been in material breach of 1441, which meant it was a causis belli. And, look, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was a dangerous person. And there's no doubt we had a body of evidence proving that. And there is no doubt that the President must act, after 9/11, to make America a more secure country. </span> </p>

A gathering threat, after 9/11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with. And it was done after 12 long years of the world saying the man's a danger. And so, we got rid of him.

Chris runs through a number of statements Clark has made on the campaign trail and, with those quotes, advances the argument that Clark, as much as Dean, has a "propensity for speaking imprecisely off the cuff." </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="531" __label="true"> There's a pretty widespread tendency in the mainstream media to say that Clark makes off-the-wall claims about the war on terrorism or the Iraq war. (A frequent example is the claim that the civilians at the Pentagon had a list of countries in line for regime change after Iraq.) It's more accurate to say that Clark has a habit of making points that many in high political circles consider impolitic, impolite or simply in poor taste to bring up. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="532" __label="true"> Case in point, there </span> <i> <span __num="533" __label="true"> was </span> </i> <span __num="534" __label="true"> a list -- if by list we mean a list of countries that many in the Pentagon (civilian side) were pushing to hit next after Iraq.

        <p> <span __num="536" __label="true"> Here's Chris' quote number two. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="537" __label="true"> Chris prefaces it with this headline question: "Bush 'never intended' to get Osama Bin Laden?" </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="538" __label="true"> And here's the quote. </span> </p> 
        <blockquote> 
         <span __num="539" __label="true"> We bombed Afghanistan, we missed Osama Bin Laden, partly because the president never intended to put the resources in to get Osama Bin Laden. All along, right after 9/11, they'd made their mind up, I guess, that we were going to go after Saddam Hussein. That's what people in the Pentagon told me. And they capped the resources, stopped the commitment to Afghanistan, and started shifting to prepare to go after Saddam Hussein </span> 
        </blockquote> 
        <p> <span __num="540" __label="true"> Is it just me, or is the story here that Chris completely distorts what Clark said? What's 'imprecise' about this statement. Provocative? Critical? Yes. But imprecise? </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="541" __label="true"> (I have to say that each of the quotes Chris mentions seems in same category to me.) </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="542" __label="true"> Clark didn't say Bush didn't intend to get bin Laden. He said he never intended to deploy the necessary resources because he placed a higher priority on the impending war in Iraq. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="543" __label="true"> Now the president and his advisors could and probably would respond that they mobilized sufficient resources for both aims. But the fact that bin Laden and many of the other key targets were </span> <i> <span __num="544" __label="true"> not </span> </i> <span __num="545" __label="true"> captured at least makes it reasonable to argue that the forces were insufficient. (Indeed, reporting on the particulars backs this up too.) </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="546" __label="true"> These are the sorts of points and arguments that </span> <i> <span __num="547" __label="true"> should </span> </i> <span __num="548" __label="true"> be at the center of the national campaign, whichever Democrat secures the nomination -- the balance of resources mobilized to combat al Qaida and Iraq, and which was more central to the country's security. </span> </p>

        <p> <span class="smallcaps"> <span __num="589" __label="true"> Well, this battle </span> </span> <span __num="590" __label="true"> in Iowa is truly going down to the wire. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="591" __label="true"> Today Zogby has a </span> <a href="http://www.zogby.com/Soundbites/ReadClips.dbm?ID=6718"> <span __num="592" __label="true"> poll </span> </a> <span __num="593" __label="true"> out with Dean 25%, Gephardt 23%, Kerry 14%, Edwards 13%. And Zogby says Edwards was picking up steam through the three days of interviews. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="594" __label="true"> Those numbers are somewhat countered by two other polls out in the last two days which have the Dean/Gephardt spread at 7% ( </span> <i> <span __num="595" __label="true"> LA Times </span> </i> <span __num="596" __label="true"> ) and 5% (Quad-City Times/KWQC). But clearly it's pretty tight. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="597" __label="true"> At various points over the three-plus years I've run this site I've commented on the quality of Zogby's polls (here's one of the first things I ever wrote about him, an </span> <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/76221"> <span __num="598" __label="true"> article </span> </a> <span __num="599" __label="true"> in </span> <i> <span __num="600" __label="true"> Slate </span> </i> <span __num="601" __label="true"> from almost four years ago). Zogby's polls do often pick up on trends well in advance of their appearance in other polls. But almost as frequently he seems to pick up on trends that turn out not to exist. So to the extent that you can personify methodology I see him as ingenious but erratic. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="602" __label="true"> That's I suppose just a roundabout way of saying that I don't know quite what to make of his very tight margin between the two top contenders. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="603" __label="true"> More generally, however, the closeness of these margins and the broader dynamics of this race, I think, tell us that we don't know what's going to happen on Caucus eve. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="604" __label="true"> The Caucus system works by a sort of snowbound version of the </span> <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08.htm"> <span __num="605" __label="true"> uncertainty principle </span> </a> <span __num="606" __label="true"> . The particulars are so detailed that I'm sure to get some part of it wrong. But basically how the caucuses work is that everyone shows up and they divide into groups based on candidate preference. But if your candidate has less than 15% of the attendees then your guy (or gal) is out. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="607" __label="true"> (Presumably, at the beginning of the evening someone gets out an envelope, counts who's there and does some quick math to determine how many people get you over 15%. I'd be ruled out for that job.) </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="608" __label="true"> Once your candidate is out you have to pick another. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="609" __label="true"> Now, the numbers we're seeing are statewide. And the demographic gap between, say, the Gephardt and Dean voters is great enough that in particular caucus locations the spread is apt to be very different. However, you don't have to look too long at the numbers to see that there are some candidates with not insubstantial support that are going to get knocked out on the first round at many locations. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="610" __label="true"> To put it succinctly, in many caucuses, the issue is going to be less whether Gephardt and Dean are separated by 2% or 6% as who the Kerry and Edwards supporters go to on the second round. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="611" __label="true"> Before you flame me with your emails, I'm not trying to prejudge Kerry's and Edwards' chances. But you can see the level of uncertainty that plays into the calculus. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="612" __label="true"> On the face of it, it would seem this volatility would work against Dean since the race has been polarized between Dean as the outsider vs. anti-Dean Washington candidates. If you're for Kerry, who has made opposition to Dean an increasing focus of his campaign, do you switch to Dean or to Gephardt, if Kerry falls under 15% if your caucus? The latter seems more logical to me. But so many factors must play in to this that I'm not sure 'logic', especially from a thousand miles away, gets you very close to the truth. </span> </p>
