The first sign is curling andtwisting (epinasty in plant physiology terms), and it may take a week ortwo to look real dead. Some resprouting may occur from areas of the rootsystem that the chemical did not reach. Respray after these sprouts reach8 or 10 inches (too soon and there may not be enough leaf area to absorbenough chemical). Triclopyr (the active chemical) is sooo much moreeffective on woody plants than Roundup. But it really does little to killgrass family plants, or rosette type weeds that are already bolting. </span>

It is also growing between the rocks to the height of 10 to 12 feet and also growing like a vine over the rocks. I got two spots the first time. It is maddening to itch like that. I went out and bought a </span> <b> <span __num="48" __label="true"> gallon of round up </span> </b> <span __num="49" __label="true"> . The kind you dilute with water to the correct consistency. I sprayed that huge plant. It has been reduced to dead leaves and dead branches. I used about one forth of the gallon to do the job. The gallon cost $85.00 but even though I am on a limited budget it was worth every penny. And I still have enough round up just in case it comes back up. Then I was clearing a spot on another part of our property and got it again. The first two places to break out were the ones where it was before and then it spread. Tonight I actually took a bath in diluted bleach. Tomorrow I am going to go spray that new plant. Thanks for your web site about the evils of poison oak and ivy.

        <span __num="68" __label="true"> Contact with poison ivy can leave you with a rash and persistent itch. This native perennial grows throughout Virginia, in woods, fields, andsometimes in the garden. It grows in sun or shade,and in wet or dry places. Its growth habit depends on where itis growing, resulting in a trailing ground cover, free-standingshrub, or a vine supported by trees, shrubbery and fences. </span> 
        <p> <span __num="69" __label="true"> All parts of the poison ivy plant contain an oil, urushiol, which causesthe allergic reaction. Most poisoning occur during thegrowing season when the presence of lush foliage increases thechance of contact, but the dormant stems and roots of the vinecan cause winter poisoning as well. Individuals vary in theirsensitivity to poison ivy, but repeated exposure can lead toincreased sensitivity. It would be a good idea for everyone toavoid this plant. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="70" __label="true"> Poison ivy appears in many forms. The leaflets vary in size,glossiness, and marginal notching, but always occur in groups of three. If you avoid all unknown plants with leaves composed ofthree leaflets, you will be playing it safe. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="71" __label="true"> Poison ivy is difficult but not impossible to eradicate. Thechief difficulty lies in the chances of becoming poisoned whentrying to remove it. Wear protective clothing, including gloves, wheneveryou are working near it. Pulling and grubbing areeffective means of removal, though they necessitate close contact and willprobably need to be repeated once or twice for complete control. If timeis not an object, the vines can be smothered by completely covering themwith black plastic for several months.Do not mow the plants as this will spew bits and pieces ofpoisonous material over the area. When removing poison ivy, takefrequent breaks to change clothes and scrub thoroughly with astrong soap. Wash contaminated clothing separately. DO NOT BURN anyplants that you physically remove. The resulting smoke cancause severe lung damage if inhaled. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="72" __label="true"> Herbicides are effective and allow you to control the plantwithout getting too close to it. Several commercial products are available. Check labels to find one that will control poisonivy, and apply it as directed. Many of the herbicides for poison ivycontrol contain glyphosate. This chemical is systemic. Itis absorbed by leaves and transferred to stems and roots, andslowly causes the death of the entire plant. It must be applied to anactively growing plant for this process to take place; donot apply it during a drought when even poison ivy will not begrowing. Glyphosate, like most herbicides labelled for poisonivy removal, is nonselective and will kill any other plants itcontacts. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="73" __label="true"> Where poison ivy has grown up tree trunks or into hedges, cut the vineat ground level. Remove as much of the stump and roots asyou can with a hoe or by pulling. As regrowth occurs, apply anherbicide to the leaves, or keep pulling up the growth. Withperseverance, and probably of few itches, poison ivy can becontrolled. </span> <font size="-1"> <br> <i> <span __num="74" __label="true"> --(f_rushingr@NOSPAMccsvax.sfasu.edu) submitted May/21/1994 </span> </i> </font> </p>

It does not breakdown, and will continue to kill anything planted on the spot until it'sthoroughly leached away--a matter of years even in regions of high rainfall.And even then, it continues to be a hazard, as it leaches into thegroundwater.

In winterI removed major sections of matted vines from the stones,after cutting all along the perimeter of the wall. I threwmulch hay along the top of the wall and it killed the poisonivy there without further ado.I knew that there'd be a good burst of new growth from the base of the big vine I chopped away and dug out, but part of thatwould be mowed as part of the yard and the other would bethe rest of the project. More runners would pull up asthe ground thawed, too.Then I waited until the leaf growth was as good as it couldbe before the seeds form. I cut the vines twice each with asharp action of the corn knife, two or more inches apart,digging aside the cut section. That takes only minutes.I usually let it rot in place or at least wilt down toa dry brown before removing it to a composting areafor ornamental, non-food uses. The </span>

It's often easy that way to get most of the ivy in a big area just by first locating a small number ofwell-spread vines. I have a spading fork, rake, and hayhook that I use to lift stubborn vines rather than cutinto the dirt with the knife. I also use nippers tofinish off each and every smaller sprout in the area.At most I'll check it to remove any resprouts, once,later in the season.If I remove a plant I replace it with something else,and I'll mulch heavily and position the replacementsonce I see that the growth is all browned out.

Most useful were the pictures (instead of the illustrations you tend to find elsewhere) which helped me realize I had more than one kind/growing habit of poison ivy growing in my yard. It took awhile, but eventually I found possible ways of washing the oil off my upholstry (you can't exactly throw a possibly contaminated couch into the washing machine.) Perhaps, if you've the time, a "section" on removing the oil from more than your hands and clothing would be useful. And lastly, simply reading about others who have gone through the same suffering as much (and more) than I am, has helped mentally.

Like glyphosate, it needed several applications at two-week intervals, but in my experience it was very effective. I know enough chemstry to appreciate its relative safety, and in my experience it's extremely selective, killing only the p.i. I can remember spraying it on a vine growing through a highbush blueberry and seeing only the p.i. leaves wilt. I'm very !$!#!$ that it seems to be completely unavailable now - perhaps because it's too cheap and commodity-like to be profitable when glyphosate and triclopyr can be sold instead? I'm tempted to try making it. I don't think it'd be too hard. My other grandmother swore by phenolic soap ['fels naptha'] for removing urushiol before the itch started, back in the '60s. </span>
