      <p> <span __num="10" __label="true"> Here's a favorite one of mine: </span> </p> 
      <blockquote> 
       <p> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="11" __label="true"> Back when I lived in New York there was this fabulous, crazy-ass juice bar on West Houston called Lucky's Juice Joint. I think it's no longer there. I hear it's moved. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="12" __label="true"> It was the most out-of-place business south of 14th Street. Hard to descibe, except as a "hardcore hippie haven". Just had this weird, crazy, psychedelic-rainforest vibe. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="13" __label="true"> But damn, it had the best juice in town. It was amazing stuff. Tasted like the fruits and vegetables were picked that morning. Fresher than anything else I found in New York. And yes, I had searched high and low for even better alternatives, but never found one. In New York, this was really it. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="14" __label="true"> The boss was this crazy looking tie-dye wearing guy who looked and talked like he had done too many drugs back in the 'sixties. A big ol' middle aged, acid-head teddy bear. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="15" __label="true"> One day we struck up a brief conversation. I complimented the hell out of his product. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> "Wow," I quietly gushed, "Your stuff is the best. It really is..." </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="17" __label="true"> "Sure it is," said the guy. "That's because we make it with reverence." </span> </p> 
      </blockquote> 
      <span __num="18" __label="true"> You don't have to get a job with a famous company or hot-shot industry in order to have a spectacular career. You just have to do what you do with reverence. </span> 
      <p> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="19"> [UPDATE:] </span> <a href="http://truetalk.typepad.com/truetalk/2004/09/penniesheaven_i_1.html"> <span __num="20"> Tom from True Talk Blog makes a TERRIFIC point: </span> </a> <span __num="21" __label="true"> "Authenticity and reverence are two sides of the same coin." </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="22" __label="true"> Yes! Exactly! </span> <br> </p>

      </blockquote> 
      <span __num="34" __label="true"> Had some more thoughts, mostly disorganised ones: </span> 
      <p> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="35" __label="true"> : Bloggers are a fairly idealisitic bunch. When you talk about spirituality within a brand context they often get a bit twitchy. I guess some kind of self-imposed purity law is being messed with. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> : Jack, a young Communications student from Australia wrote me today: </span> </p> 
      <blockquote> 
       <span __num="37" __label="true"> I'd like to see the future of advertising in blogs. I can see how they're part of it. But to be honest, I don't think I see the bigger picture. </span> 
      </blockquote> 
      <span __num="38" __label="true"> So I write back: </span> 
      <blockquote> 
       <span __num="39" __label="true"> Very few people can see the big picture, including those at the top of the industry. </span> 
       <p> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="40" __label="true"> The Communications industry can't see the big picture because it doesn't yet have a mechanism to handle </span> <a href="http://www.mathjmendl.org/chaos/"> <span __num="41" __label="true"> Chaos Theory. </span> </a> </p> 
      </blockquote> 
      <span __num="42" __label="true"> Worse than that, it doesn't have any business models that allow them to do what they do cheaply. They only have expensive models. All those mouths to feed, all those executive golf club memberships to pay for etc etc. </span> 
      <p> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="43" __label="true"> You know that celeb on that TV show you watch? You know, the one with the fancy-schmancy lifestyle your long-sufferring wife spends all her time enviously reading about in the tabloids? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Where does the celeb gets the means to buy all that cool stuff? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="45" __label="true"> That's right. From your paycheck. Her money comes from you. Because the money that pays for her TV appearances comes from advertisers, who get their money from you when you go to Wal-Mart and buy their products that you saw advertised on your celeb pal's TV show the night before. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="46" __label="true"> Nice to see all that hard-earned money you take home from the job at the paper mill going to help such worthy causes, like a new beach house in Malibu etc. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Big Media Celebrity Worship is corporate feudalism at its finest. The little people paying for the big people. I think it's cute. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="125" __label="true"> But 25 or so years ago Microsoft asked themselves one of the best questions ever in the history of business: </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="126" __label="true"> “If hardware was free, how would Microsoft make a living?” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> They had seen the writing on the wall. They saw hardware (i.e. the white boxes and circuit boards that make up PCs) eventually becoming a commodity. They looked into the future, and saw the price do nothing but go down. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="128" __label="true"> And this was years before hardware became commodified. They decided software was where the action was; they’d let companies like Dell or Toshiba worry about the ever-commodifying molecules. They would just focus exclusively on the bit that would retain its value over time i.e. the software. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="129" __label="true"> Apple didn’t spot this. Apple held on to hardware. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Apple nearly went under. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="131" __label="true"> Microsoft became one of the biggest companies in the world. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="132" __label="true"> Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="133" __label="true"> So here’s my question to my fellow advertising folk, in the same vein: </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="134" __label="true"> “If they made advertising illegal overnight, how would your company make a living?” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="135" __label="true"> Seriously. Any fool company can come up with a decent campaign brief. Any fool company can produce an award-winning TV commercial. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="136" __label="true"> That’s no longer where the value is. Like computer hardware, that part of the business has become commodified. The real long-term, non-commodified value is elsewhere. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="137" __label="true"> So where’s the non-commodified part? Seriously. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="138" __label="true"> I have an idea. It's very exciting. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="246" __label="true"> "Sex &amp; Cash" is a book about how to deal with the creative bug properly without it </span> <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000535.html"> <span __num="247" __label="true"> ruining your life. </span> </a> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="248" __label="true"> The book will have about 15-30 thousand words. It will be small and thick; I'm thinking 5 x 8 inches. Mixed in with the main text will be hundreds of my cartoons, which will compliment the writing. </span> </p>

A lot of people daydream about living the creative life, about being a writer, artist, whatever, even if they don't really have anything to say or really want to do the actual work. This book is not for them. This book is for people who already have a few ideas of their own, who may already be well on their way, but maybe could use a wee push. It's not an instruction manual. It just shows where some of the land mines are buried, and gives direct and unapologetic advice on how to avoid stepping on them. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="253" __label="true"> It will be very different from the usual touchy-feely "Personal Creativity" fare. It'll have a bit more bite to it. It will not try to romantisize the creative life, nor try to convert people to living it. The aim is not to make the reader feel comforted, validated or make it all seem easier than it actually is. The main thesis of the book is just to get on with it; that only when one has dropped all those clichéd romantic daydreams about being creative, does the world actually start paying attention, do things actually start moving forward. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="254" __label="true"> The book introduction will have similar to the preceding two paragraphs. </span> </p>

"The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often.

      <p> <span __num="364" __label="true"> A drunk Scottish guy in a pub told me this story. Fisk away. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="365" __label="true"> Chess pieces are wee representations of ancient warfare. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="366" __label="true"> 1. Pawns. Foot soldiers. They were ordered to advance, fight to the death, and never retreat. Manoeuvring a phalanx of them in any direction other than forwards was pretty much impossible until the advent of the highly trained, highly drilled professional soldier, which didn't appear until much later with the Romans. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="367" __label="true"> 2. Knights. In ancient times, Calvary never advanced head on, but flanked i.e. they went around the back and attacked at the side. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="368" __label="true"> 3. Rooks. The original chess rooks were not castles, but war elephants. Elephants are fairly unstoppable once they get going, but not very manoeuvrable. Hence they can go in straight lines- forward, backward, left, right- but little else. In ancient times war elephants carried little “castles” on their backs, from which archers would fire down (think Lord of the Rings). Europe has no elephants, but does have castles. So the latter caught on. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="369" __label="true"> 4. Bishops. Chess predates Christianity in Europe. The original bishop pieces were actually sailing ships. Sailing ships never go straight, but tack to the left or right i.e. diagonal. The sail of the ship resembles the bishop’s crown. The bishops's crown was stylistically adopted in Europe during the Dark Ages, as Chistianity spread and naval warfare went into decline after the fall of the Roman Empire. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="370" __label="true"> 5. The Queen. The Queen’s entourage was always looked after by a small, elite, highly trained bodyguard. The imperative to protect the women and children was very strong. If trouble was afoot it needed to get the hell out of Dodge very quickly. Ergo the bodyguard was very mobile and very deadly. It needed to be. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="371" __label="true"> 6. The King, though powerful and free to choose any direction he wanted, was heavily laden with the apparatus of state. The King could not just drop everything and flee; he had the court, the treasury and the ministers weighing him down. So his movements were fairly limited. </span> </p>

Of course, this isn't principally a communication problem; it's a product problem. The only thing I could think that might save their business at this point would be a massive recall/refund for every customer with a U-lock. But this is also a communication problem. As a customer (I have four of their locks), I would really like to know whether this problem affect their other products, or whether it is limited to that Evolution 2000. But their communication on this sucks. The story broke online, yet there is nothing about it on their web site. They could really, really use a blog to try to contain the damage ASAP. But looking at their actions so far, I am not optimistic. </span> 
      </blockquote> 
      <span __num="468" __label="true"> Can you imagine how much money Kryptonite would have saved if they only had the foresight to let one of their smarter writers keep a company blog? </span>

        <p> <span __num="519" __label="true"> Taking on board what I've learned from blogging </span> <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000217.html"> <span __num="520" __label="true"> Young Adam </span> </a> <span __num="521" __label="true"> , this is how I'd design a commercial blog for a big-budget movie. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="522" __label="true"> 1. I would keep the blog entries as short and sweet as possible. </span> </b> <span __num="523" __label="true"> Movie goers have short attention spans. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="524" __label="true"> 2. I would post links to do with all the people invloved. </span> </b> <span __num="525" __label="true"> If John Travolta was the star I would blog all the interesting stuff on him I could find. His love of flying airplanes or whatever. The blog would become as much an A-Grade source for Travolta information as it would for the film. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="526" __label="true"> I would do likewise for all the other actors, and the director, and even the producer. The point of publicity is to make the recipient feel like he/she is getting real, juicy, insider info. A feeling not unlike the college student gets when the bouncer finally lets him in to the club. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="527" __label="true"> "Make them feel like they're getting behind the velvet rope" etc. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="528" __label="true"> 3. I would keep on hammering away on why I think it's a good movie. </span> </b> <span __num="529" __label="true"> I would never let them forget I think it's a good movie. Ever. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="530" __label="true"> 4. If the movie was getting any "buzz", I'd report on that too. </span> </b> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="531" __label="true"> 5. I would make sure the blog had an authentic voice. </span> </b> <span __num="532" __label="true"> Of course, if it's a great movie my job is easier. If the movie is a total dud, I would dig deeper in order to find whatever merit I could. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="533" __label="true"> The way to do that, obviously, is not to compare it with Citizen Kane. Better to realize that even a mediocre movie has a good story behind it- the combined results of millions of dollars and roomfulls of smart, driven people. Try to find the brightest people on the project and try to bring their energy in to the equation. Even if it's the worst movie ever, there might be some amazingly wonderful person working in the costume department or whatever. Try to tap into that side of things. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="534" __label="true"> 6. Talk about the actual business. </span> </b> <span __num="535" __label="true"> Perhaps explain to people the compelxities of a distribution deal or whatever. Try to make them see where the movie fits within a billion dollar industry. Cultivate intrigue. Again, people want to be 'insiders', it's hard-wired into our systems to want to belong to the Alpha Group. Get them beind the velvet rope, any way you can. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="536" __label="true"> 7. Start early. </span> </b> <span __num="537" __label="true"> To build awareness of the movie properly needs at least least a year, preferably two. It's not about telling millions of people at once. You talk to a few thousand at a time. Let the word spread gradually. </span> <i> <span __num="538" __label="true"> Give it time to seep into the Zeitgeist, like absinthe on a sugar cube. </span> </i> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="539" __label="true"> 8. Buy media. </span> </b> <span __num="540" __label="true"> Word-of-mouth is good, but not always reliable. Buy the means to drive the necessary eyeballs to your site, and charge it to your client at an honest profit to yourself. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="541" __label="true"> 9. Allow comments. </span> </b> <span __num="542" __label="true"> Let your readers contribute, the more the better- it builds interactivity, word-of-mouth, and most importantly, credibiltiy. That being said, have no qualms about deleteing rude ones and banning ISP addresses. "Trolls" are never helpful. Be prepared to police your blog vigilantly. </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="543" __label="true"> 10. All this is in vain without some kernel of intellectual honesty informing your every action. </span> </b> </p>

       <span __num="582" __label="true"> These bundling strategies are not stable of themselves, they exist only within the context of technology, distribution and transaction costs surrounding them. When these change, bundles may collapse. The CD is the obvious example. With individual digitized songs now easier to duplicate and distribute than the physical bundle, the albums raison d'etre has disappeared. As the simple playlist replaces the album's remaining value of simplifying choice, CDs commence a slow glide to oblivion, moderated only by the installed base of equipment and consumer habit. </span>

It also provides opportunities for those who can add value (and convenience and perspective and even fun)... In this new distributed, unbundled, post-marketplace, molecular, commoditized media world, value can be added in many ways. It's about relationships. It's about relevancy. It's about service.

       <span __num="638" __label="true"> New Delhi. Thirteen September 2004. I awoke, jetlagged and sweaty, at 3A.M. I’d had a nightmare. Stark realism. I was, as usual, accused of overstatement and a few (or more) too many exclamation marks (!!!!!). Only this time I’d acceded to “They.” The “They” who believe in The Plan and Built to Last and Continuous Improvement and Quiet, Humble Leaders. No! No! I had failed, in my dream, to live up to my Fervent Beliefs! This must not pass! In a sweat, fearful that the time would not come ‘round again, I turned on the light, picked up a pad of paper, and began to scribble frantically. Herewith the result. </span>

       <span __num="1020" __label="true"> Inspiration precedes the desire to create, not the other way around. </span> 
      </blockquote> 
      <span __num="1021" __label="true"> One of the reasons I got into drawing cartoons on the back of business cards was I could carry them around with me. Living downtown, you spend a lot of time walking around the place. I wanted an art form that was perfect for that. </span> 
      <p> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="1022" __label="true"> So if I was walking down the street and I suddenly got hit with the itch to draw something, I could just nip over to the nearest park bench or coffee shop, pull out a blank card from my bag and get busy doing my thing. Seamless. Effortless. No fuss. I like it. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="1023" __label="true"> Before, when I was doing larger works, every time I got an idea while walking down the street I’d have to quit what I was doing and schlep back to my studio while the inspiration was still buzzing around in my head. Nine times out of ten the inspired moment would have past by the time I got back, rendering the whole exercise futile. Sure, I’d get drawing anyway, but it always seemed I was drawing a memory, not something happening at that very moment. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="1024" __label="true"> If you’re arranging your life in such a way that you need to make a lot of fuss between feeling the itch and getting to work, you’re putting the cart before the horse. You’re probably creating a lot of counterproductive “Me, The Artist, I must create, I must leave something to posterity” melodrama. Not interesting for you or for anyone else. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="1025" __label="true"> You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="1026" __label="true"> Conversely, neither should you fret too much about “writer’s block”, “artist’s block” or whatever. If you’re looking at a blank piece of paper and nothing comes to you, then go do something else. Writer’s block is just a symptom of feeling like you have nothing to say, combined with the rather weird idea that you SHOULD feel the need to say something. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="1027" __label="true"> Why? If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. I the meantime, you’re better off going out into the big, wide world, having some adventures and refilling your well. Trying to create when you don’t feel like it is like making conversation for the sake of making conversation. It’s not really connecting, it’s just droning on like an old, drunken barfly. </span> <br> </p>
