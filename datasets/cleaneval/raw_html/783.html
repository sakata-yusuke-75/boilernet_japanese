Thus it confirms the notion that the rhetorical signing statement isn't directed at mass public opinion, but rather elite opinion since elites are more important to the day to day matters of governing. There is already good evidence that in the aggregate, we know the president will issue more rhetorical signing statements when there is a federal election or when his poll numbers are in a state of flux--but that doesn't tell us much about the use of the device at the individual level. It is a promising area of study that still needs a great deal of attention. </span>

     <br>

     <span __num="151" __label="true"> Today, President Bush was busy with his 10:00 am </span>

     <span __num="157" __label="true"> during a time of war. It is the same room where the Bretton Woods Treaty and the UN Charter were signed, a mere coincidence, I am sure. </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="158" __label="true"> After finishing the press conference (which lasted less than an hour--only one question each for those lucky enough to get the call), President Bush walked down the hall to Room 450 in the Eisenhower Office Building, where he signed a real bastard child of a bill, the "Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006." In a </span> 
     <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061220-2.html"> <span __num="159" __label="true"> ten-minute statement </span> </a> 
     <span __num="160" __label="true"> , President Bush spelled it out--the bill was about tax reform, renewable energy, affordable health insurance, helping farmers, and busting open oversea markets. Like I said--a real bastard of a bill (there were five different versions of the bill). </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="161" __label="true"> But while it was all smiles across the way from the White House, the protectors of prerogatives toiling away inside the White House and down the street at the DOJ office produced </span> 
     <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061220-5.html"> <span __num="162" __label="true"> the non-public signing statement </span> </a> 
     <span __num="163" __label="true"> --the one that contains the real "meat and potatoes." In it, President Bush issued six (at least) signing statements with some interesting comments. </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="164" __label="true"> In the second paragraph, he took exception to two provisions that ordered him to submit particular recommendations to the Congress, which he noted (as he has done many times before) that the Constitution gives the power to the president to determine what he will or will not recommend. But for good measure, he also tossed in that the provision also impinged upon his authority to "supervise the unitary executive branch" (his ability to tell which executive branch officials to come up with the particular recommendations). </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="165" __label="true"> In the next paragraph--and an interesting one at that--he decides to treat as advisory and not mandatory a provision that requires the "concurrence of State officials as a precondition to the execution of the laws..." Now mind you, President Bush ran as a governor, Reagan Republican, and "state's righter," yet here he is qualifying a provision that allows a state governor (and this particular provision involves western states) a say on how the federal government can lay claim to private lands (something that </span> 
     <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=18055"> <span __num="166" __label="true"> Republicans boiled about </span> </a> 
     <span __num="167" __label="true"> during the Clinton administration). As such, and to make sure that everyone knew he meant it, President Bush writes that he has the authority to treat this condition as advisory because of the Constitution's "vesting in the President of the executive power and the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Wow. Calling in the big guns when you begin to rely on the vesting clause of all things. </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="168" __label="true"> Finally, in the last paragraph, President Bush qualifies a mandate that he consult with certain congressional committees whenever he monkeys with the Carribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, among other things. This particular provision deals with trade benefits for Haiti. Here again, similar to the previous paragraph, President Bush is overriding the concerns of certain legislators who are attempting to protect businesses in their districts or states from perceived unfair trade deals that benefit Haiti ("In General--Haiti shall be eligible for preferential treatment under this section if the President determines and certifies to Congress that Haiti..."). </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="169" __label="true"> I have to credit the administration, though, regarding the publicity of the signing statements, giving the press and public ample opportunity to keep check. First, Tony Snow tells those reporters in attendance that the President is signing bills and then today, on the White House website where the </span> 
     <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061220-2.html"> <span __num="170" __label="true"> signing ceremony information resides </span> </a> 
     <span __num="171" __label="true"> , the White House has provided a link to the private statement that makes all the challenges. So nothing underhanded here (other than alluding to a number of objectionable provisions without specifying precisely which ones are being singled out--but that is what researchers are for). </span>

     <span __num="181" __label="true"> from a private nuclear company operating in India, which expects to see a lot of business as a result of yesterday's signing of the US-India Nuclear Cooperation Promotion Act. The company, Thorium Power, was one of the </span>

     <br> 
     <i> <br> <span __num="184" __label="true"> Seth Grae, Thorium's Chief Executive Officer, and Ambassador Dennis Hays, the company's Vice President and Director of Government Relations, joined senior administration officials, members of Congress and representatives of the influential Indian-American community as President Bush officially opened nuclear trade relations between the United States and India. The signing of the agreement will enable Thorium Power to pursue opportunities in a country that currently boasts the fastest growing nuclear sectors in the world. </span> </i> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="185" __label="true"> There is a bright side to yesterday's signing statement and signing ceremony. It was picked up, in detail, by the press. Trouble is, the press that noticed was not domestic but rather based in India. First, in the </span>

     <span __num="189" __label="true"> was a benefit to India, and also noted, pleasingly, that the parts of the act where Congress attempted to limit India's benefit, the President stepped in to "allay" India's fears because President Bush told Congress he would treat those sections as "advisory." </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="190" __label="true"> And a news site dedicated to "connecting the Telugu community", an editorial also finds support in President Bush's signing statement, taking a paragraph to explain to the readers what a signing statement is and why they are important--or at least how the editorial understands their importance: </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <i> <span __num="191" __label="true"> US presidents have often used such signing statements to interpret a law the way they choose without taking the extreme step of rejecting a bill outright with a veto.

     <br> 
     <span __num="192" __label="true"> Pretty good. </span>

     <span __num="195" __label="true"> the reauthorization of the "Ryan White CARE Act," named for Ryan White, the young boy in 1990 who died of AIDS after receiving the disease from infected blood that was transferred into him via treatment for hemophilia. The official title of the bill is the "Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006" and the signing statement was purely rhetorical. It is also important to note that incoming-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also sent along </span>

     <span __num="197" __label="true"> in support of President Bush's signing statement. Now let's see if she will make it a practice of attaching her own signing statement to bills that are sent to the President. President Bush also </span> 
     <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061219-1.html"> <span __num="198" __label="true"> signed </span> </a> 
     <span __num="199" __label="true"> the Combating Autism Act of 2006, which President Bush notes that he is "proud to sign this bill into law and [he is] confident that it will serve as an important foundation for our Nation's efforts to find a cure for autism." To make sure of the rhetorical value of these two signings (there was no formal signing ceremony), Press Secretary Tony Snow </span> 
     <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061219.html"> <span __num="200" __label="true"> announced </span> </a> 
     <span __num="201" __label="true"> the signings at the start of his noon press gaggle. By getting zero questions about it, or about the duplicitous statements yesterday, I think the administration got its answer. </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="202" __label="true"> Finally, to round things off, President Bush signed two other bills--again of the rhetorical variety but not mentioned at the gaggle: HR 5466: the "Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail Designation Act" and S. 3678, the "Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act" which created a new agency--the "Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority" inside Health and Human Services and "authorizes appropriations through 2011 to improve bioterrorism and other public health emergency planning and preparedness activities." </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="203" __label="true"> What is noteworthy about today's signings? It is the first time since President Bush's first term that he issued a string of signing statements that did not challenge any provisions of the law. In fact, by looking at my data, we have to go all the way back to President Bush's first several signing statements, all of which were garden variety rhetorical statements. </span>

It was not publicly announced. There were no cameras, dignitaries, reporters--nobody. This signing statement is only three paragraphs long, but don't let it's small size fool you. This one means business. </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="230" __label="true"> In this particular signing statement, the President: </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <span __num="231" __label="true"> Tells Congress that one section* of the bill, where Congress thinks it is setting policy, will only be treated as advisory; </span> </li> 
      <li> <span __num="232" __label="true"> Treats as advisory a provision** that cuts the President out of approving of any nuclear item to India that runs contrary to the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines; </span> </li> 
     </ul> 
     <span __num="233" __label="true"> President Bush does continue with the frustrating routine of making a challenge to several different sections for several different reasons without making it clear precisely which section he is challenging and why. Thus President Bush writes: </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span> <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;"> <span __num="234" __label="true"> The executive branch shall construe provisions of the Act that mandate, regulate, or prohibit submission of information to the Congress, an international organization, or the public </span> <a name="SR;567"> </a> <a name="SR;570"> </a> <span __num="235" __label="true"> , such as sections 104, 109, 261, 271, 272, 273, 274, and 275, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to protect and control information that could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties. </span> <br> <br> </span> </span> 
     <span __num="236" __label="true"> Thus all of the attention that the signing received was directed precisely where the administration wanted, and away from the sections of the bill that the President has undermined, and by looking at Google News, </span> 
     <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ncl=1112058697"> <span __num="237" __label="true"> it appears it worked. </span> </a> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="238" __label="true"> For those of you who are counting along with me, here is the numbers to date: </span> 
     <br> 
     <br> 
     <span __num="239" __label="true"> With today's challenges, President Bush has issued a total of 137 signing statements and has made 1097 separate and distinct challenges to the provisions of the laws he has signed. It is clear that we won't have the type of signing statement we saw this time last year, but President Bush could be noteworthy by issuing one more signing statement and breaking over that 1100 mark! </span>

The administration had informally asserted executive privilege on behalf of nearly any executive branch official who had been summoned to testify. Traditionally, executive privilege was a power that only the president could assert. Early in Clinton's first term, Clinton tried and failed to assert executive privilege on behalf of Hillary in relation to the work she did on behalf of the Health Care reform task force. However, in W's first term, the privilege was extended to the VP over records pertaining to the energy task force. Given that the Republicans never challenged the assertion of the privilege on behalf of the attorney-general, or the Secretary or State, or the national security advisor, etc. We will see whether that leads to a new challenge before the Court. </span>
