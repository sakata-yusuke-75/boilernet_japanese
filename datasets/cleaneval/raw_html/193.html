After being raised toMaster Mason on April 17, 1877, Rhodes drafted a program for world dominionby the British race patriots. To guarantee the funding from his vast wealthof his world vision for the British empire, Rhodes wrote in 1877 the firstof seven wills that he composed over his lifetime. The first will calledfor the formation of a "secret society" whose primary function would befocused on returning England to her former glory. He viewed English Freemasonryand its conspiracy as impotent and in effect defunct in this regard. Ironically,when the society Rhodes had envisioned was finally organized after hisdeath, its membership consisted only of English Freemasons.
