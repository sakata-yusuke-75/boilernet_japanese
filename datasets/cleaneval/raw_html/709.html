We just passed the "4 million slides scanned" milepost this year. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="19" __label="true"> When it comes right down to it -- there are 4 main reasons why you should select a particular company to digitize your valuable and irreplaceable family memories. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="20" __label="true"> 1. A reputation for quality and customer satisfaction is number one. We pride ourselves in our track record since we started business back in 1995. We have always made sure that each and every one of our customers are treated with professionalism along with a personal touch. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="21" __label="true"> 2. State of the art equipment is a must and we use nothing but the finest scanners available on the market today. All mounted film (slides &amp; negatives) is scanned with Nikon Coolscan 5000 ED scanners with Digital ICE (infra-red film surface dust and defect elimination technology). We use the finest equipment and processes for our film transfers to DVD. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="22" __label="true"> 3. A broad range of options to choose from. We have tried to bring as many options as possible to our customers. We have options to fit the needs of everyone from professional photographers to the hobbyist, and to the family history and genealogy buff. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="23" __label="true"> 4. And finally -- Cost. We believe that cost should be the final decision maker after the other three. Fortunately for you, our costs are as low as or in almost every case substantially lower than our competitors. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="24" __label="true"> We convert your slides and negatives into industry standard </span> <br> <span __num="25" __label="true"> TIFF ( tif ) or JPEG ( jpg ) image files, not proprietary formats such as Kodak's PictureCD or PhotoCD. With Kodak's proprietary formats, you are limited to the usefulness, ability to copy, and compatibility with your software. There has never been a better time for transferring slides toDVD. </span> <br> <span __num="26" __label="true"> This is a great opportunity to pass your precious memories to your kids and their kids. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="27" __label="true"> So take your time -- look around our web site.

Among my responsibilities includes overseeing the transition of many departmental materials to digital format for presentations' access via database, and storage. This includes coordinating the digitization of our existing store of some 10,000 patient neuroimaging studies, which have been routinely stored as photo slides over the last eight to ten years. After viewing their web presence, speaking personally about our needs' and completing a formalized bid process, Larsen Scanning Service was selected to implement this initiative. </span> <br> <span __num="104" __label="true"> As we near the halfway point in this slide digitization process, I can say that we in the Department of Neurosurgery have been quite pleased with the performance and professionalism of this scanning service. Not only are they able to handle the considerable volume of slides in a timely fashion, but the application of the digital cleaning system has resulted in slides that have been digitally restored to new likeness, at times in spite of significant debris and wear to the slide. </span> <br> <span __num="105" __label="true"> With new sets returning to us on a regular basis, I can safely state that Larsen Scanning Service is readily capable to handle high quality scanning projects on a large scale with pleasing results.
