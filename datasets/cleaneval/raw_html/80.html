   <p> <span __num="3" __label="true"> Our knowledge of the logical and natural foundations of many field isslight, or at least dubious or imperfect. Certainly </span> <u> <span __num="4" __label="true"> subjects differdrastically in the </span> </u> <span __num="5" __label="true"> relative strength of their foundations, or in theapparent </span> <u> <span __num="6" __label="true"> fundamentality of their </span> </u> <span __num="7" __label="true"> concepts, methods, principles,theories, achievements, research, language, logic, etc. </span> </p> 
   <p> <u> <span __num="8" __label="true"> Ideonomy can compare the foundations of different disciplines todiscover </span> </u> <span __num="9" __label="true"> analogies, differences, commonalities, interdependences, contradictions,redundancies, interpenetrations, convergences, common goals and needs,unities, etc. </span> <u> <span __num="10" __label="true"> It can use these to suggest </span> </u> <span __num="11" __label="true"> omissions, errors, commonopportunities for research or discovery, ways to redescribe the foundationsof one subject in terms of the foundations of another, reciprocal problemsand fallacies, equivalent principles and entities, joint ignorance, newtests and experiments, higher standards, useful priorities, strategiesof theory, etc. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="12" __label="true"> It can suggest ways in which to combine or transform certain conceptsor dimensions so as to generate or define 'all' possible or important conceptsor things, or the spaces and manifolds thereof. Contained or implicit withinsuch sets, spaces, and manifolds may be concepts or other things that cansupplement or deepen the foundations of the subject to which they pertain. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="13" __label="true"> Moreover, examining or merely experiencing such enlarged perspectivesupon what is possible may lead to the realization that what has been takento be fundamental within a subject is not really fundamental; or at least,that the foundations--or supposed foundations--of the subject are not asfree of assumptions, problems, inelegant features, superfluous elements,discrepancies, idiosyncratic aspects, etc as has been thought. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="14" __label="true"> Since ideonomy seeks to discover all of those natural concepts, dimensions,representations, entities, phenomena, laws, principles, relationships,etc that are </span> <u> <span __num="15" __label="true"> supremely </span> </u> <span __num="16" __label="true"> universal, fundamental, important, essential,minimal, logical, generative, necessary, transcendental, and pantological,it is in a privileged position to advance the foundations of arbitraryfields. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="17" __label="true"> It is in fact a principal goal of ideonomy to make all sciences morescientific, and among the best ways of doing this are by rectifying, enlarging,and extending the foundations of these subjects. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="18" __label="true"> There is a hint that ideonomy may be on the verge of discovering someunsuspected category of being that is more fundamental than either ideasor things, or that transcends what is meant by both the "mental" and "physical''aspects of reality. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="19" __label="true"> By placing all of the things and phenomena in a subject upon basic scales--asof duration, time, Population, importance, complexity, or entropy--ideonomycan call the mind's attention to what is only naturally the most and leastfundamental in a subject, to the way in which things derive their greateror lesser fundamentality from one another, to the direction in which thatwhich is truly or most fundamental is apt to be found, or to the propertiesthat fundamentals or foundations are likely to or must have. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> Knowledge or theory of the foundations of many subjects is impairedby a conscious or unconscious failure to identify, define, characterize,or emphasize the most fundamental, central, or final topic, concept, phenomenon,substance, law, entity, goal, or the like of the subject (or the set ofsuch things). Then again, the supreme topic or whatever may have some terribleunsolved problem or difficulty associated with it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Thus the supreme concern of physics is no longer clear, the arch concernof sociology is in dispute, the goal of psychology is in flux, the essentialnature or defining properties of life are unknown to the science of life(or to biology), and even the basic object of study of mathematics (itcannot be </span> <u> <span __num="22" __label="true"> number </span> </u> <span __num="23" __label="true"> , though the nature of number is an enigma in anycase), cosmology (what is the described or effable 'universe' </span> <u> <span __num="24" __label="true"> itself </span> </u> <span __num="25" __label="true"> a part of?), and ideonomy ( </span> <u> <span __num="26" __label="true"> ideas </span> </u> <span __num="27" __label="true"> , as hinted above, may not be sufficientlyfundamental) is mysterious. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="28" __label="true"> Ideonomy can be used to define concepts in new and ever more fundamentalways, and it has already been used to define life, or to reduce it to aset of ninety-two fundamental properties. The set of 8,464 possible dyadiccombinations of the primary properties have demonstrated such extraordinaryinterest that they promise to revolutionize theoretical biology, somethingwhich at once illustrates the importance of clarifying fundamentals andsuggests that the traits that were used to define the phenomenon of "life"were indeed fundamental. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="29" __label="true"> On the other hand, the same bit of ideonomic research also highlightedthe problems that plague all efforts to resolve fundamentals or to getat the genuine foundations of a subject; for it was found that the sameset of ninety-two basic properties of "life" have either analogs or exactequivalents in the supposedly inanimate phenomena of subjects other thanbiology. Thus forms or analogs of procreation, natural selection, and evolutioneither may or do exist in fields such as physical chemistry, geology, psychology,and cosmology. The implication may variously be that life is not limitedor peculiar to biology, that life must be otherwise defined or definedvia other properties, that the essential phenomena of biology should includemore than organisms, or that biology should be recast into a superscienceincorporating many other sciences or that--like mathematics--applies toall science. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="30" __label="true"> An old way of advancing the foundations of a subject is by improving,formalizing, or axiomatizing its logic; and a new or just now emergingway, by giving the subject cognitive form, which means the form of thoughtitself. Ideonomy can help with both of these approaches, particularly inconjunction with computer software and hardware. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="32" __label="true"> To think about anything one needs some manner of conceptual framework,a schema upon which to hang ideas or in which to develop, interweave, andexperiment upon different concepts. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Ideonomy, in effect, can enable such conceptual schemes, structures,and systems to be mass produced; it can widen their scope, diversify them,enhance their power, increase their connectivity or interrelatedness, greatentheir mobility within and between fields, enlarge their rationality ormake their logic more explicit, give the individual the power to freelymanipulate them, etc. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="399" __label="true"> Goals are often pursued that are the wrong ones, but they are not abandonedbecause they have never been made explicit.

The thingsthat are required for the goal to be achieved can be investigated, decidedupon, and implemented. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="400" __label="true"> Ideonomy by its nature encourages the comparative study of every sortof goal in every sort of field, and profitable knowledge can be derivedfrom this of the larger and more efficient ways and means of pursuing arbitraryor all goals.

It is also true that itis premature to absolutely exclude the possibility of teleological phenomenaor of "final causes" from physical nature.

   <p> <span __num="427" __label="true"> One way to begin the scientific study of good would be to examine thenature, circumstances, and existence of a single-random or particular-thingin an effort to discover all goods of or connected with the thing, or everyway and degree in which any or every thing is or is not 'good' for thething or 'from the thing's perspective'. </span> </p>
