Cancer devastated her body, but never her spirit and her love of life she fought for so valiantly, and so long. The memory of her will live on to help ease the pain that we, who loved her deeply, feel at her passing. My sweet Michelle, I miss you so! </span> <br> <span __num="9" __label="true"> Grandma Ilona Richardson, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Ilona Richardson (Coeur d'Alene, ID 83815) hrichardson@ispwest.com </span> <br> <br> </li>

She never gave up hope in her battle, she always had her sense of humor and made the best of the situation.. I came in contact with Michelle last year when I was going through a colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. I was very scared, being only 23 and having gone through this at a young age, she was able to relate to the anxiety and fear I was experiencing. She gave me hope and courage no matter what the outcome would be. Thankfully, I was clear, but later that year I lost my grandmother and my grandfather both to cancer. They were both only in their 60's and they raised me, so this was like losing my parents. Her words gave me strength, and her story inspired me to make the most of every day and to live my life to the fullest. I will truly miss Michelle and my thoughts and prayers go out to her grieving family as I understand what they are going through. May they find some peace in knowing Michelle is no longer suffering. </span> <br> <span __num="11" __label="true"> Kate Shandelson (Saugus, CA) automaton@mindspring.com </span> <br> <br> </li>

I'd had suspicions that she wasn't doing well since I had invited her to some shows and she hadn't replied. I figured she was doing poorly and just didn't want to be seen or to have to talk about it. Michelle was first diagnosed while she was directing my play in the Minnesota Fringe Festival. Even while she was in treatment she went ahead and directed the show. Throughout her entire illness, with every setback she was still fighting, taking lessons, auditioning, etc. I was continually amazed at her will to live and keep going. I feel bad that I just now found out and wasn't able to go to her memorial. My deepest condolences to her family and all of her other friends. Goodbye, Michelle. </span> <br> <span __num="25" __label="true"> Laura Winton (Minneapolis, MN) fluffysingler@yahoo.com </span> <br> <br> </li>

We shared laughter about the antics of our rats, and I cry knowing I will never talk across the virtual ether to her again, I have lit a candle for your family, and pray that I will also meet Michelle at the Rainbow Bridge, Them most amazing thing about Michelle was not only her courage but her Wonderful Sense of Humour. I felt I knew her and I loved her like a daughter. And I truley believed she was called from this world as there the need for a New Angel in Heaven, and Every time you have that pain in your hearts it is just Michele Plucking your Heart Strings and Skating around your Souls saying "I have not left you, My Spirit is here with you, and I will be with you always Till we meet again at the Bridge". And she will welcome all with her Cheeky Humour and Beautiful smile and with Love with Wrap you all in Her Angels Wings. May your memories of her Bring you Joy and keep you smiling.

I am utterly devastasted that she is no longer with us. It is so unfair that such a beautiful person had such a short life. I found her site when I was first diagnosed &amp; everything she went through at first was identical to what I was going through. She helped me so much when I thought I couldn't get through this. She would e-mail when I was down &amp; give me encouragement. She gave me such hope &amp; now I am just totally devastated. I feel so bad that I just found out now. I just want her family to know that I prayed for her daily &amp; that you should be so proud &amp; were so lucky to have had such a wonderful &amp; beautiful angel in your life. I know that she is looking down on all of us that she helped &amp; loved &amp; she will continue to help us. My heart is hurting so much right now. Even though I only talked to her on-line, I considered her a dear friend. My hope was to meet her in person one day. I will miss her more than words can say.
