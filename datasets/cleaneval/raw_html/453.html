It is truethat nothing is so important as religion, and one must defend it at anycost [summâ vi] .... It is true that it must be protected, but bydying for it, not by killing others; by long-suffering, not by violence;by faith, not by crime.

   <span __num="190" __label="true"> to do so.

This principle is to be accepted not so muchbecause it is the consistent teaching of the Ordinary Magisterium, thoughit is (as Mr Davies establishes in his pamphlet) but more because its negationis absurd. </span> 
   <p> <span __num="191" __label="true"> The traditional teaching does however have one huge deficiency, theremedy of which does much to defuse the objections of a modern audience.Thisdefect is simple. Inadequate allowance is made for the intellectual spacethat is required for faith to grow. The traditional teaching views thehierarchy of the Church as ultimately wise and knowledgeable, and the Magisteriumcertain and </span> <a href="DefinitionOfDoctrine.html#Magisterial Infallibility"> <span __num="192" __label="true"> infallible </span> </a> <span __num="193" __label="true"> on all matters. Similarly, it views the </span> <a href="Ministry.html#Laity"> <span __num="194" __label="true"> laity </span> </a> <span __num="195" __label="true"> as ignorant. Hence, it asserts that they should be </span> <a href="Ministry.html#Authoritarianism"> <span __num="196" __label="true"> docile </span> </a> <span __num="197" __label="true"> and entirely passive in receiving the teaching, admonitions and judgementof the Magisterium. The business of the laity is to do and believe whatit is told. There is no need or place for question or debate&nbsp; Thelaity have no competence to do either. If something cannot be understoodor seems to be wrong, it must nevertheless be accepted without hesitationas right: just on the basis of authority. Whatever comprehension is appropriateshould later be sought over time in prayer. Anyone with good will can beexpected to recognize the truth of the Magisterium's decrees more or lessimmediately. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="198" __label="true"> Now in fact, all this is far from the case. For those who are not Catholics,the Magisterium has no particular credibility and commands little respect.This is first because there is no reason why the opposite should be thecase, and second because the Magisterium has manifestly been mistaken on </span> <a href="Themes.html#Mutability of Official Teaching"> <span __num="199" __label="true"> anumber </span> </a> <span __num="200" __label="true"> of significant matters and has generally not had the grace toface up to this.

For dissent to be anythingother than harmful, it has to be birthed in pain and fire, otherwise itwill lead to cynical scepticism and a loss of all faith. Dissent basedon a consciousness of an injustice done to some individual or group becauseof the imposition of some mistaken doctrine or practice is a differentmatter. This is a matter of charity for the victim(s) of injustice. Itis a prime duty for every person of good will to defend victims of injustice:even if the perpetrator of the injustice is </span>

   <p> <span __num="665" __label="true"> In my opinion, the only sensible measure would be to restrict the styleand position of buildings dedicated to dissident use so as to make themunobtrusive.

   <span __num="669" __label="true"> Quite by accident, I have recently read J.S. Mill's monograph on "Liberty".I found it to be an exciting and thought provoking book, and heartily recommendit. Mill points out that there are a number of reasons for allowing oreven encouraging dissent: </span> 
   <ol> 
    <li> <b> <span __num="670" __label="true"> Received conventional or "traditional" wisdom is entirely wrong. </span> </b> </li> 
    <ol> 
     <li> <span __num="671" __label="true"> In which case the only hope that truth and justice may be attained is bygiving head to dissenting voices. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="672" __label="true"> A minority view should not be allowed to prevail or be accepted as correctany more than the majority view: but it requires more institutional supportand consideration just because it is a minority or dissident view. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="673" __label="true"> Generally, dissident views are repressed and silenced by overbearing authority:hierarchical, social or economic, with no account as to their rightnessor justice. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="674" __label="true"> On those occasions that unconventional truth has prevailed against popularfalsehood, it has done so when civil or social authority has been in astate of flux, and so vulnerable to such a healthy subversion. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="675" __label="true"> A good example, is the official Catholic and Orthodox teaching on "love,sex and friendship". </span> </li> 
    </ol> 
    <li> <b> <span __num="676" __label="true"> Received conventional or "traditional" wisdom is partly right and partlywrong. </span> </b> </li> 
    <ol> 
     <li> <span __num="677" __label="true"> In which case, the corrective or complement of its partial truth may besupplied by some dissident view; itself only partly right. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="678" __label="true"> A good example here is the necessary dialogue between Western Catholicismand Eastern Orthodoxy. </span> </li> 
    </ol> 
    <li> <b> <span __num="679" __label="true"> Received conventional or "traditional" wisdom is entirely correct. </span> </b> </li> 
    <ol> 
     <li> <span __num="680" __label="true"> Without the challenge of debate, it will ossify into what Cardinal Newmancalled "Notional Assent". </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="681" __label="true"> This is an empty formal acceptance of some proposition as being true, withno understanding of what it signifies, and certainly without the acceptanceof its truth having any practical impact on the conduct of one's life! </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="682" __label="true"> This is typical of most Catholics today. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="683" __label="true"> It is the entire basis of conventional "Ecumenism". </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="684" __label="true"> Because their faith is neither challenged by external persecution nor bytheir own attempts to convert non-Catholics to the True Faith, most Catholicshave little idea of what in fact they believe. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="685" __label="true"> The irritent of dissidence (but of disidence challenged and engaged, notsimply winked at and "tollerated") is necessary to produce the pearls ofpractical wisdom and living faith. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="686" __label="true"> The acceptance of dogma, on the basis of "authority" alone is an emptyacceptance, and no amount of positive study and rationalisation can makeup the deficit left once the external challenge of controversy has beenlost. </span> </li>
