        <p> <b> <span __num="45" __label="true"> 1. INTRODUCTION </span> </b> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="46" __label="true"> The origins of computing machinery can be traced back to 3000years ago when the Chinese introduced a primitive form of abacus,or 300 years ago when Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz invented thefirst arithmetic machines. For us at CERN it all started 30 yearsago when one of the first electronic digital computers, a hugeFerranti Mercury, was installed. It was the beginning of a successstory which has changed the way to do physics and, as a matter offact, to do any work at all in the Laboratory. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> The story goes on and the changes brought in by the newinformation technologies continue to affect us at an astonishingrate. Those who witnessed the beginning of the information era wereconscious of the potential impact of those mar marvellous machineson Physics as well as on Society, but they could hardly imaginewhat was to come. In retrospect, we can say that the 30 years whichseparate us from the days of those first generation machines, havebeen years of struggle, of sweat and tea tears, of doubt and ofpainful reappraisal, but also years of discovery, of excitement, ofachievement and of pride to the actors in this uniqueadventure. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Of those 30 CERN years, I missed only the first three. I did notmiss, however, the joys of programming first generation machines,although in a different environment. Actually, when I joined CERNearly in 1962, the only machines around were still made out ofvacuum tubes. I am, therefore, rather well placed to tell mypersonal account of the </span> <i> <span __num="49" __label="true"> what, why and how </span> </i> <span __num="50" __label="true"> of the evolutionof automatic computing at CERN. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> I shall not even attempt to be exhaustive, let alone objective.I shall tell the story as I saw it, or rather as I lived it.Instead of compressing 262800 hours into 1, I shall select andreport only those events which, in my opinion, are either realmilestones or make an interesting story, and I shall follow themthrough to their consequences, even if this means breaking thestrict chronological order. The basic features of the largehigh-performance systems which have played a major role in the CERNComputer Center are listed in </span> <a href="#Appendix"> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Appendix1 </span> </a> <span __num="53" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
        <p> <b> <span __num="54" __label="true"> 2. THE BIG BANG </span> </b> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> It took six days for God to build the Universe and a little overtwo years for the Ferranti engineers to produce our </span> <b> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Mercury </span> </b> <span __num="57" __label="true"> ,a large assembly of complex circuitry hidden inside a row ofaustere cabinets, making few concessions ons to people's curiosity.At about the same time the PS was built in five years and today onecan build accelerators 1000 times more powerful, always in aboutfive years. The Mercury was 1000 times less powerful (16.6 kHz)than a modern personal computer which is now mass-produced byrobotized assembly lines at the rate of 2 or 3 per minute! </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> The purchasing contract was signed on the 25th of May, 1956 andstipulated that </span> <i> <span __num="59" __label="true"> the machine with 1024 40-bit words of </span> </i> <b> <span __num="60" __label="true"> fast </span> </b> <span __num="61" __label="true"> [ 120 microsec to read/write one word from theaccumulator] </span> <b> <span __num="62" __label="true"> core store </span> </b> <i> <span __num="63" __label="true"> and a </span> <b> <span __num="64" __label="true"> slow </span> </b> </i> <span __num="65" __label="true"> [8.75 mseclatency] </span> <b> <span __num="66" __label="true"> drum store </span> </b> <i> <span __num="67" __label="true"> having a total capacity of 16384words of 40 binary digits, </span> </i> <span __num="68" __label="true"> would be shipped to CERN </span> <i> <span __num="69" __label="true"> in earlyFebruary 1957 and installation shall be completed by 1st May,1957.... The details of the progress of manufacture will besubmitted at intervals of one month. </span> </i> <span __num="70" __label="true"> The Mercury had a clockcycle of 60 microsec. It took 180 microsec to add and 300 microsecto multiply two long words of 40 bits. It had floating pointarithmetic. Division, however, had to be programmed. It isinteresting to note the absence of the word </span> <b> <span __num="71" __label="true"> software </span> </b> <span __num="72" __label="true"> fromthe contract, the only relevant mention being: </span> <i> <span __num="73" __label="true"> any programs andsub-routines which Ferranti will prepare will be made available toCERN free of charge. </span> </i> <span __num="74" __label="true"> Unbundling and licensing were unknownin the 50's. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="75" __label="true"> The computer actually arrived during the summer of </span> <b> <span __num="76" __label="true"> 1958 </span> </b> <span __num="77" __label="true"> and passed the acceptance tests in October of that year. Followingits successful introduction, a thick file of orders revealed theurgent need for spare valves and of </span> <b> <span __num="78" __label="true"> tape bins </span> </b> <span __num="79" __label="true"> (a criticaldevice in those days of punched paper tape input/output!). </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="80" __label="true"> At the end of 1958, the availability of a programming languagecalled </span> <cite> <b> <span __num="81" __label="true"> Autocode </span> </b> </cite> <span __num="82" __label="true"> , attracted the first users tothe computer centre and marked the beginning of the 30 years ofcomputing covered by this paper. It is interesting to note that thefirst </span> <cite> <span __num="83" __label="true"> Mercury Autocode </span> </cite> <span __num="84" __label="true"> compiler was written in 1956(by R. A. Brooker), two years before the appearance of the first </span> <b> <span __num="85" __label="true"> FORTRAN </span> </b> <span __num="86" __label="true"> compiler! It had many features which appeared laterin FORTRAN. Due to memory limitations, variable names wererestricted to a single alphabetic character (5-bit Ferranti code).It is worth noting that in the mid 50's the European computerindustry was still competitive. As far as competence, innovativeideas and successful products are concerned, European companieslike </span> <cite> <span __num="87" __label="true"> Ferranti, English Electric </span> </cite> <span __num="88" __label="true"> and </span> <cite> <span __num="89" __label="true"> Elliott </span> </cite> <span __num="90" __label="true"> in England, </span> <cite> <span __num="91" __label="true"> Telefunken </span> </cite> <span __num="92" __label="true"> in Germany and </span> <cite> <span __num="93" __label="true"> Bull </span> </cite> <span __num="94" __label="true"> in France had little to envy their Americancompetitors (e.g. </span> <cite> <span __num="95" __label="true"> ERA/Remington Rand, NCR, IBM </span> </cite> <span __num="96" __label="true"> ). Thesize and the drive of the American market were, however, going tomake the difference quite rapidly in the 60's. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="97" __label="true"> The reasons behind the decision to acquire a Mercury weretechnical, political and financial. Technically the Mercury wasdefinitely one of the most advanced machines around. It wasconsidered superior to the Ferranti Pegasus, to the Elliott 404, tothe English Electric 'Deuce', to the Bull 'Gamma 311' and todrum-type machines like the IBM 650. Ferranti was set up to producea dozen units and CERN was going to get serial number 6. The factthat Harwell and Saclay had ordered Mercury's was given a certainweight. CERN had no experience in electronic digital computers andit was better to be part of a club of users. As to the price (onemillion Swiss Francs), it was five times cheaper than equivalentAmerican machines like the ERA 1101. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="98" __label="true"> Discussions went on for several months at CERN in 1955 and 1956.External experts were involved. Fifteen years after Konrad Zuse'srelay-based Z3 considered by many as the first general purposecomputer, ten years after the electronic ENIAC, and six years afterMaurice Wilkes' EDSAC, people were still debating on the virtues ofbinary versus decimal machines, on the importance of floating pointarithmetic, on the size of words (the Z3 had 22-bit and the EDSAC32-bit words; the ENIAC was a decimal machine with 10 digitswords. The size of central memory was 64 words for the Z3, 2n forthe ENIAC and 512 for the EDSAQ, and on the best way to input andoutput data (punched film, 5-7-8 channels papertape, or cards).Practical problems had to do with the unreliability of thehardware, the organization of the operations and the recruitment ofexperts. Obsolescence was already a problem. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="99" __label="true"> CERN decided that the machine should be purely binary, that32-bit words were too short, and that the speed should be as highas possible (in particular multiplication time should be under amillisecond). It also concluded that the speed and size ofmemory were very important </span> <i> <span __num="100" __label="true"> (several tens of thousands of binarydigits </span> </i> <span __num="101" __label="true"> were a clear necessity), while the availability offloating point hardware was considered a </span> <i> <span __num="102" __label="true"> very desirable,although not quite indispensable, feature of a scientificcomputer. </span> </i> <span __num="103" __label="true"> But what really </span> <i> <span __num="104" __label="true"> makes it worthwhile to have amachine, is the enthusiasm for carrying out the most difficultcomputations, </span> </i> <span __num="105" __label="true"> as an American physicist put it in a letterdescribing his experience with a digital computer or </span> <i> <span __num="106" __label="true"> 'thecourage to go ahead and solve problems which would have seemed toodifficult to do otherwise.' </span> </i> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="107" __label="true"> The computers of that time had colorful names like ILLIAC at theUniversity of Illinois, AVIDAC at Argonne, MANIAC, UNIVAC, etc...Most of them were prototypes. Everything was very muchexperimental. The operations arrangements at the ILLIAC weredescribed as follows: </span> <i> <span __num="108" __label="true"> 'The user deposits his punched paper tapein a box with instructions or the operator. The operator takesthese tapes, and inserts them in the machine in turn. If the codeis correct, the machine delivers the answers and these may bepicked up by the user the next morning. If there are errors in thecode, the operator carries out the test routines requested and theresults of these tests are deposited so that these may be reviewedby the user the next morning. Thus, the whole operation of themachine becomes a fairly automatic affair'. </span> </i> <span __num="109" __label="true"> This was more orless the style adopted for our operations thirty years ago. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="110" __label="true"> One of the first applications at CERN was the analysis of thepapertape produced by the Instruments for the Evaluation ofPhotographs (IEPs), used to scan and measure bubble chamber film.The first reports convey a certain deception due to the slow taperead/write speed. Since everything had to go through theaccumulator, the CPU was blocked during I/0. It was immediatelyclear that there was a big mismatch between the power of thecomputing engine and its input/output capability. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="111" __label="true"> After some struggling with faulty tubes, tape bins, machineinstructions and </span> <cite> <span __num="112" __label="true"> Autocode </span> </cite> <span __num="113" __label="true"> , people with lots of datadiscovered the existence of an IBM 704 in Paris, which offeredsignificant advantages such as </span> <b> <span __num="114" __label="true"> magnetic tape units, cardreaders, line printers and FORTRAN! </span> </b> <span __num="115" __label="true"> FORTRAN II allowed6-characters variable names and, most important, it simplified theexchange of programs with Berkeley and Brookhaven. The 1959 CERNAnnual Report indicated </span> <b> <span __num="116" __label="true"> already </span> </b> <span __num="117" __label="true"> that </span> <i> <span __num="118" __label="true"> as the needsincrease, it will be necessary to envisage the replacement of theMercury by a more powerful system. </span> </i> <span __num="119" __label="true"> It was also quickly realizedthat these so-called electronic brains required quite a lot ofhuman effort to be effectively exploited. Hence the proposal todouble in 1960 the computer center staff (from 10 to 20). </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="120" __label="true"> So, by the end of the 50's, the fundamental forces, sociologicaland technological, characteristic of every computer service, hadbeen discovered, including the illusion that upgrading theresources would solve all the problems and achieve the ultimategoal, i.e. </span> <b> <span __num="121" __label="true"> make the users happy! </span> </b> </p>

        <p> <span __num="123" __label="true"> The next big news was the arrival of the </span> <b> <span __num="124" __label="true"> IBM 709, </span> </b> <span __num="125" __label="true"> animproved version of the 704, in January 1961. It was still a clumsyvacuum tube machine but it featured FORTRAN and all those fancyperipherals apt to improve the </span> <i> <span __num="126" __label="true"> quality of life </span> </i> <span __num="127" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="128" __label="true"> The word length was 36 bits, the characters became 6-bit BCD,and the core memory size jumped to 32K. The CPU was 4-5 timesfaster than that of the Mercury. However, to compile a </span> <b> <span __num="129" __label="true"> typicalFORTRAN program could take several minutes! </span> </b> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Tape bins made wayfor card trays. Magnetic tape units read and wrote at 75 ips on 7tracks and the density was 200 bpi. Peripherals were attached viatheir controllers to data channels. It was a significant advance inthat it allowed as many as six peripheral devices to access corememory buffers while the CPU performed other work. Anotherimportant device which came with the 709 was the so-called DirectData Connection, allowing for direct transmission of data fromexternal equipment to memory via a channel. The speed was notridiculous: in principle up to 1 Megabit/sec. The 709 was alsoequipped with one of the first </span> <b> <span __num="131" __label="true"> interrupt systems. </span> </b> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="132" __label="true"> The bad news was still the poor reliability, although theprogress was already quite substantial. Unscheduled maintenancerepresented 11% of the total time. Scheduled maintenance took awaya time slice of similar size. So the down-time of the 709 comparednot too unfavorably with the up time of the very first electroniccomputers.... The on-line card reader and the printer did, however,slow down the operations considerably. After one year of experienceCERN added a small IBM 1401, in order to speed up the input/output,the job sequencing and the operations. The concept of SPOOLing(Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line) with its 1/0 files(virtual reader/printer) has its origins in those days. Programmingfor the 709 was considered a difficult activity to be left to thespecialists who could understand and keep up-to-date with the newtechniques and the operating conventions. The machine was </span> <b> <span __num="133" __label="true"> anexpensive resource </span> </b> <span __num="134" __label="true"> which had to be used efficiently. To give anidea, the list price was in the region of ten millions francs(1960 Swiss francs!). In those days a </span> <b> <span __num="135" __label="true"> magnetic tape cost 60 $(some 260 </span> </b> <span __num="136" __label="true"> SF!). It was at that time that the first inescapablecommittees </span> <b> <span __num="137" __label="true"> appeared, e.g. </span> </b> <span __num="138" __label="true"> Computer Scheduling Committee,Computer Users Advisory Committee and the Data Handling PolicyGroup. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="139" __label="true"> The Mercury had still its faithful users but suffered from thechronic lack of modern, fast peripherals. In 1962, as part of alifting operation, it was enhanced by the connection of an Ampextape unit, </span> <i> <span __num="140" __label="true"> compatible with IBM specifications </span> </i> <span __num="141" __label="true"> and operatingat 3333 characters per second (over 3 times the speed of thefastest paper tape reader and some 20 times faster than a tapepunch). Also, two papertape-to-card converters were installed </span> <i> <span __num="142" __label="true"> toease the transfer of data from the Mercury to the </span> </i> <span __num="143" __label="true"> 709. By theend of 1962 it was possible to read the paper tape from IEPs intothe Mercury, give it a first processing pass, write the resultson magnetic tape and input it onto the IBM 709 for furtheranalysis. The first application packages appeared at that time,e.g. THRESH and GRIND used for the geometrical reconstruction andkinematic analysis of bubble chamber events. It is amusing to notethat, in spite of the growing workload and the frantic developmentof codes, the machines were normally switched off at weekends. Butthe practice of 24 hours/day, 7-days/week service was around thecorner. It is also in interesting to realize that things like theconnection of the Ampex tape unit to the Mercury were entirelydesigned and implemented on site. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="144" __label="true"> The next problem was how to use all those </span> <cite> <span __num="145" __label="true"> Autocode </span> </cite> <span __num="146" __label="true"> programs on the 709. One just wrote an </span> <cite> <span __num="147" __label="true"> Autocode </span> </cite> <span __num="148" __label="true"> compiler for the 709. The difficulties of developing software weresoon to be learned. The first Conference recognizing the existenceof a software crisis was held in Munich in 1968. Why is softwarealways late and unreliable? People working today with modern CASE(Computer Assisted Software Engineering) or OOP (Object OrientedProgramming) tools are still trying to solve the problem. But theanswer in those days was: </span> <b> <span __num="149" __label="true"> better programming languages </span> </b> <span __num="150" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="151" __label="true"> CERN FORTRAN was defined to ensure compatibility with otherlaboratories and facilitate portability of codes. It was felt,however, that FORTRAN was used </span> <i> <span __num="152" __label="true"> mainly for historical reasons </span> </i> <span __num="153" __label="true"> and new, more powerful languages would be needed to fully exploitthe potential of the electronic computer. As we all know, CERN wasnot affected by, or it missed completely, the language explosionwhich started in the early 60's. ALGOL, Lisp, PL/I, PASCAL, ModulaII, ADA, C, PROLOG, etc... did not raise above the level ofminority cultures. FORTRAN evolved through its versions II, IV, 66,77, 8X, and it still dominates the CERN programming landscape. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="154" __label="true"> It took some time to saturate the 709, but it was already clearthat young physicists were becoming addicted. It was at that timethat the first embryonic Operating System appeared under the nameof FORTRAN Monitor System. Many other important events occurredin the early 60's, such as the connection of computers on-line tofilm measuring devices including the very fast automatic </span> <b> <span __num="155" __label="true"> flyingspot digitizers </span> </b> <span __num="156" __label="true"> (HPD, Luciole, etc..) forerunners of the modernimage digitizers and the first attempts to connect computersdirectly to experimental equipment (on-line experiments). The IBM709 was operated on-line to an HPD to measure both bubble and sparkchamber films. In September 1963 the 709 was replaced by a </span> <b> <span __num="157" __label="true"> 7090, </span> </b> <span __num="158" __label="true"> a transistorized version of the same machine, about fourtimes more powerful. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="159" __label="true"> It was at that time that the investments and the efforts startedto pay off. Over </span> <b> <span __num="160" __label="true"> 300 000 </span> </b> <span __num="161" __label="true"> frames of spark chamber film wereautomatically scanned and measured in record time using an HPDFlying Spot Digitizer on-line to the 7090. At about the same timecomputers were connected on-line to experiments to monitor theequipment and to collect digital data from the first filmlessdetectors (e.g. sonic spark chambers) onto magnetic tape. The firstsuccessful demonstrations with fully auto automatic digital patternrecognition showed that computers could be programmed to replaceslow human operators in a variety of tasks. Stories about computersdoing things faster, better and more reliably than human beings gotaround producing the usual mixture re of emotional reactions. In1970 the European Physics Society held a Conference at CERN on the'Impact of Computers on Physics' and I remember the reassuringstatement of an eminent physicist that 'so far computers have notsignificantly contributed to any discovery'. It was going to takeanother decade to see the HEP community wholeheartedly acceptingthe computer as a critical component of their research andadmitting it to their current technological foundation trilogy: </span> <b> <span __num="162" __label="true"> accelerators, detectors and computers. </span> </b> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="163" __label="true"> 1970 was also the year when the </span> <b> <span __num="164" __label="true"> 'CERN Computing and DataHandling School' </span> </b> <span __num="165" __label="true"> was launched to educate young physicists andstimulate the sharing of computing experience between high-energyphysicists and computer scientists. It turned out to be anexcellent idea. The School is still alive and well, fulfilling aclear need. As to the cross-fertilization across thephysics/computer science boundary, it has developed into an idealpartnership. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="166" __label="true"> Actually the two disciplines have influenced each other from thevery beginning. It was the physicist Bruno Rossi who built thefirst logic circuits which then were developed into computerhardware, and physicists have always been among the mostdemanding consumers of computer cycles. Enrico Fermi, when asked inthe early fifties which research project would he recommend to theyoung Italian physicists, told them to design and build a computer.Indeed, physics research could not have become what it is withoutthe computer, and conversely, the development of the computer hasbeen deeply influenced by the needs and vision of basicresearch. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="167" __label="true"> The study of the fundamental properties of elementary matterinvolves the frontiers of human knowledge and pushes the technologyto the limit of what is possible. Computer scientists have beenplaying with models and formalisms, architectures and languages,inventing tools and methodologies of a rather theoretical natureand they have been sometimes accused of developing generalsolutions in search of specific problems. When a dense problemspace meets a rich solution space some good news can beexpected... Evidence of synergistic effects has been accumulatingever since the beginning of the information era. </span> <b> <span __num="168" __label="true"> High-energyphysics and information technology </span> </b> <span __num="169" __label="true"> are among those disciplineswhich, in the second half of our century, have shown the mostimpressive advances. </span> </p>

This resulted in anon-trivial amount of changes, thus deserving the renaming to CERNSCOPE. The 6600 was connected to various FSD systems and to twoon-line computers, the SDS920 and the IBM 1800, via CERN-made datalinks.
