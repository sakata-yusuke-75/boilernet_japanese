Stratosphere officials declined to reveal how much money they shelled out for their newest fuzzy, four-legged security officer, but according to marketing director Chuck Davidson this was no pound puppy. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="28" __label="true"> "He was a sizable investment. We took a lot of time and spent a lot of money. There's two things you look at in a dog, ability and temperament. A lot of times it's a trade off. You either get a great dog that's technically proficient in his skills or you get one with a great temperament. We spent the money to get both. He's very gentle. Little kids come up to him and grab him in the face and he's just fine with it. He enjoys the attention, but when he gets the command, he's all business." </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="29" __label="true"> Dex Von Der Pulschnitzquelle, is a full-blood German shepherd who was actually born in Germany. In fact, his commands are still in German. The dog arrived in the United States for training at Rudy Dexler's School for Dogs in Elkhart, Ind. in October and he's been on the job since December. When he's not being petted and pampered by hotel guests and employees, the canine is hard at work learning the ropes in a new high-rise home where even riding an escalator can be a challenge. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="30" __label="true"> Dex doesn't go it alone though. Stratosphere security guard Steve Lieberman, a guard who has been with the property since it opened in 1996, was selected to be the dog's constant companion. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="31" __label="true"> "I had a German shepherd up until my early 20s. I really didn't want another dog at that point. I just didn't feel I'd get one as good as Silver. But when I heard that they were going to have a trained dog, I knew that would be something I'd like to do," he said. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Lieberman beat out more than a dozen other hopefuls to get the job. Then he spent almost a month in Indiana training with Dex at the school for dogs. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Dex is trained in obedience, explosive detection, area, article and building search, criminal apprehension, tracking and scouting. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="34" __label="true"> "He's here to ensure the safety of the customers along with the associates and employees that work at the property. That includes everything from patrolling the casino and parking garages all the way to the executive offices and the tower shop mall here, along with the tower and the base of the tower," Davidson said. "With the addition of Dex, we have what we feel is one of the most significant security forces in the city which is very appropriate not only with the events of Sept. 11 but for everything that occurs here at this property." </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="35" __label="true"> Dex and Lieberman are on call 24 hours a day. At night they both go home to Lieberman's southwest Las Vegas home. During their off hours the duo are planning to be of service to the community beyond the tower's walls. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="36" __label="true"> "We're working closely with (local police) and the fire department to make Dex available when the need arises in the community for a dog of his kind. Also we're in the process of working with the Clark County School District to start a K-9 awareness program where the local schools can become familiar with what a dog like Dex is used for," Davidson said. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Dex already has his own security badge (worn by Lieberman who said the dog's better looking) and his own business cards. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="38" __label="true"> "We have some plastic badges coming in that will say Stratosphere K-9 Unit, have his name on it and a picture of a German shepherd. There also may be some training cards," Lieberman said. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="39" __label="true"> So far, Dex is fitting in great. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="40" __label="true"> "Everything has been positive in the casino. Every time I walk through the retail mall or even the casino, I hear people remarking how beautiful he is to begin with. But they also like the idea of a dog in the casino. They feel safe," Lieberman said. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="41" __label="true"> Sales Coordinator Betty Sullivan never thought she liked dogs, until she met Dex. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="42" __label="true"> "Usually I'm very afraid of dogs, but this one is so friendly. I gave him a birthday card on his 2-year birthday and everyone signed it. He can't read, but I gave it to Steve and he'll read it to him." </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="43" __label="true"> "For all of his training, he's unbelievably friendly," Davidson said. "You can pet him, you can play with him." </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="44" __label="true"> "He enjoys working," Lieberman said, "and the petting from all guests and the associates don't seem to make a difference to the job. When it's time to work he'll work." </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Dex's press conference Jan. 22 was interrupted when the dog sniffed a suspicious rental truck in the parking lot. Lieberman said rental trucks are frequently false alarms since the trucks are often used to transport fireworks, which can leave a residue. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="46" __label="true"> "He'll hit on any type of black powder, smokeless powder, flash powder, fuses, military or civilian detonators, explosives, firearms or even ammunition," Lieberman said. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="47" __label="true"> For Dex, it's all play. </span> </p> <p class="storybody"> <span __num="48" __label="true"> "Everything is a game to him. He has no idea this is work," Lieberman added. </span> <br> <br> <br> <span __num="49"> &lt;&lt;-- </span> <a href="./"> <span __num="50"> [back] </span> </a> </p> </td>
