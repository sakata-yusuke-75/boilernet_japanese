This happens with water when the temperature reaches 100°C. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> But at different pressures, water will boil at different temperatures. For example, at the top of Mount Everest the pressure is so low that water will boil at about 70°C. Depressions from the Atlantic can easily lower the atmospheric pressure in the UK enough so that water will boil at 99°C - even lower with very deep depressions. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Whenever we just talk about "the boiling point" of a liquid, we always assume that it is being measured at exactly 1 atmosphere pressure. In practice, of course, that is rarely exactly true. </span> </p> </font> <pre></pre> <font color="#000000" face="Helvetica, Arial" size="4"> <p> <b> <span __num="57" __label="true"> Saturated vapour pressure and solids </span> </b> </p> </font> <font color="#000000" face="Helvetica, Arial" size="3"> <p> <b> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Sublimation </span> </b> </p> <p> <span __num="59" __label="true"> Solids can also lose particles from their surface to form a vapour, except that in this case we call the effect </span> <b> <i> <span __num="60" __label="true"> sublimation </span> </i> </b> <span __num="61" __label="true"> rather than evaporation.
