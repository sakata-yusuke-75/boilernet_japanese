A confusion, which is the most disgraceful aspect of the “language issue”. </span> </p> <p> <font color="red"> <b> <i> <span __num="158" __label="true"> However, I wish to begin </span> </i> </b> </font> <span __num="159" __label="true"> with two more obvious examples of linguistic prejudice. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="160" __label="true"> (1) In an otherwise liberal-minded article on languages and their value ( </span> <i> <span __num="161" __label="true"> You are what you speak </span> </i> <b> <span __num="162" __label="true"> New Scientist </span> </b> <span __num="163" __label="true"> 30 November 02) a subtle “pro-English” linguistic chauvinism became evident. The linguist Slobin has done research into the way that a group of languages </span> <i> <span __num="164" __label="true"> (including English) </span> </i> <span __num="165" __label="true"> have “colourful” verbs which express movement in terms that are “dynamic, full of energy”. Other languages </span> <i> <span __num="166" __label="true"> (including Romance languages) </span> </i> <span __num="167" __label="true"> are described has having “prosaic verbs” and “lacking colourful verbs”. All these terms are value laden. Would it not be better to consider why English/Russian etc are so “subjective” in comparisons with “objective” Romance languages? Are French/Spanish etc really “lacking”?In this context I ask readers to note RWE’s use of the words “devotee”, “protagonists”, “unnecessary complication”, and “[the] dangerous and destructive [bilingual] highway signage.” </span> </p> </font> <p> <font size="2"> <span __num="168" __label="true"> (2) My second example is Paul Starling’s </span> <b> <span __num="169" __label="true"> Welsh Mirror </span> </b> <span __num="170" __label="true"> .

Many Sikhs may have Punjabi as their mother-tongue, yet English may be their language of choice, they may be more comfortable speaking English away from the home. Using their mother-tongue in dealings with the State, however, may be an important way for them to express their ethnic identity. A right to use Punjabi in relations with the State, if it is provided for one group, must be available for all who speak Punjabi – including Sikh converts who may be non-Aryan. Punjabi in this case becomes a communal language, not an ethnic language. A close reading of RWE’s essay will reveal that “ethnic language” is a better description what he outlines. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font size="2"> <span __num="182" __label="true"> English is my mother tongue, but Welsh is my chosen communal language in dealings with the State (form filling, advice lines etc).

I accept that there is a problem with the design of bilingual road signage – the confusion is usually caused by alternating monoglot English and Welsh signage, or by changing the relative position of the two languages, sometimes with Welsh on top, sometimes English. But the only way to “promote” Welsh is to make it </span> <i> <span __num="198" __label="true"> visible, and accepted as normal </span> </i> <span __num="199" __label="true"> . Bilingual road signs and official documents are amongst the best ways to do this.
