<span class="x-nc-sel2">ANAHEIM ? So, meet Illinois.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">OK, some of you are probably saying, "I know Illinois. It's that state next to Indiana, the one where the motto is vote early and often.' That's where Chicago is."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">So let me be more specific: Meet the University of Illinois football team.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Now, some of you are probably saying, "They have a football team?"</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">As a matter of fact, it does, and it's in town this week to play USC in the Rose Bowl, but your surprise is probably understandable.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">After all, it's been 24 years since the Illini ? that's the school's nickname, by the way ? wandered out from Champaign (that's where the campus is located) to play in the Rose Bowl.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Since then, every other Big Ten team has made at least one appearance except Minnesota and Indiana ? and Michigan's been here nine times, for gosh sakes. (Somehow, the Wolverines even managed to win three times.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">So the Illini are, to say the least, a fairly unfamiliar part of the annual New Year's football pageant. None of the current players had been born the last time they were out here, which is probably a good thing; they might have been scarred for life by watching UCLA maul Illinois 45-9 in the 1984 Rose Bowl.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">What this means is that all the traditional aspects of Rose Bowl week, which for locals are as routine as December temperatures in the 60s, are new and exciting for Illinois. They actually thought it was a big deal to go to Disneyland on Wednesday, and are looking forward to tonight's beef bowl, both of which are no more novel to USC's players than, say, text messaging.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">But it also means you probably don't know a lot about the Illini, particularly since it's been a few years since there was anything to know beyond, well, that they weren't very good.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Illinois is making its first bowl appearance of any kind in six years ? in the current bowl-for-every-city climate, that's hard to do ? and during their five-year absence, it was on the sidelines on merit. Illinois went 13-47 in that time. As recently as last year, Illinois was 2-10.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">This year, it is 8-3, which is good news and bad news.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The good news is that, having emerged from five years of darkness, the team is truly excited to be here, and recognizes this is a chance to introduce itself to a lot of people.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"I think this whole season's been kind of a coming-out party," said running back Rashard Mendenhall, "and for us to come here and cap it off with a good game against USC, that would be a good end to our season."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The bad news is, well, Rose Bowls aren't particularly kind to teams with three losses. There have been six in 20 years, and they're 0-6. Going all the way back to 1916, when Brown (5-3-1) came out to play Washington State, and lost, teams with three losses are 4-17.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">So history is against them. What else do you want to know?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Well, Illinois has a quarterback named Juice (Williams), a star linebacker who goes by the first name of J (Leman), as well a Dere (Hicks) and an Arrelious (Benn). And people think it's only the offspring of Hollywood celebrities have unusual names.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">They also have a coach named Ron Zook, which must come to some surprise to people down in Florida. Before he came to Illinois, Zook spent three years as head coach of the Gators, where he was under fire practically from the moment he was hired ? the whole "fire(name of coach here).com" thing, now a staple of disgruntled alumni everywhere, may well have originated with Zook in Florida ? and was basically painted as the worst coaching hire south of Gerry Faust.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Yet here he is, bringing Illinois to Pasadena, which no Illini coach has done in 24 years ? and there have been three other guys who had the opportunity since Mike White did it in 1984. If any new Web sites are being created about him in Illinois, it's to praise Zook, not to bury him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"Coach Zook established a vision for this program," said Leman ? that's right, just J ? "and that was believing (it could be) a top-notch, top-10 program. He brought in fresh talent, some of the best in the talent  and he meshed that young talent with the old veterans. He often said, if you agree to become a team, that's how good we'll be."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Anyway, you'll probably get to know a lot more details between now and game day, but if you really wanted to understand what exactly Illinois is, you only had to be at Wednesday's news conference featuring the Illini and USC during their visit to Disneyland.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">While the media swarmed over Zook, Williams, Leman, and three other Illinois player, USC coach Pete Carroll sat for long periods without a single interviewer. When the half-hour for interviews was up, there were still reporters waiting to talk to the Illini; most of the Trojans had already taken off to ride the Matterhorn, or the Teacups, or whatever else struck their fancy.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">So meet Illinois.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">They're new and different ? at least on the Rose Bowl stage ? so don't be surprised if they get most of the attention from now until game time.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Come Jan. 1, we'll see how they handle the attention.</span>
