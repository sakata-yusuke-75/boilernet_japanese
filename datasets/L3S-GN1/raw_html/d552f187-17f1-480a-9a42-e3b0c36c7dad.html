<span class="x-nc-sel1">Profile: Harry Flashman</span>
</b>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The world that awaited Brigadier-General Sir Harry Flashman upon his expulsion from Rugby School in the late 1830s glowed with imperial pink and throbbed with the promise of adventure. Its lands rang to the clash of sabres, and from its distant fleshpots curled a heady whiff of exoticism. Lesser men might have been changed by their experience of it, but throughout his many years of swashbuckling, fornication and delinquency, Harry, at least, remained what he had been; a total swine.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It was scoundrels such as Flashers, though, who largely fashioned the triumph of the Victorian age. Smooth, wily and practically stoned on self-enrichment, he gets to witness some of the greatest events of 19th-century history - the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Indian Mutiny, Rorke's Drift and the Retreat from Kabul - and with each fiasco his eminence and fortune increase.</span>
</p>
<div class="mpuad">
<div class="adtxt">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">advertisement</span>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It took the death last week of his creator - or, more accurately, re-creator - George MacDonald Fraser to finally stop him. Thirty-five years ago, Fraser, an ex-newspaperman, raised in Carlisle, had the idea of making Flashman, the hulking bully of Thomas Hughes's classic Tom Brown's Schooldays, into the central character of a new novel.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Hughes gives us little information about the original Flashman, beyond his fondness for persecuting Tom. He is: "?though strong and big, in poor condition from his monstrous habits of stuffing and want of exercise," and tends, in the book, to operate as a symbol of all that Hughes, an ascetic Christian socialist, saw as the godless character of the nation's schools. Towards the end of his days at Rugby, Flashman, after an outing to a nearby village, is expelled for drunkenness.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Tom, as we learn from Hughes's lesser-known follow-up novel, went seamlessly on to Oxford. But whatever happened to Harry?</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Fraser claimed to have the answer. In the late Sixties he announced the discovery of several volumes of Flashman's handwritten memoirs wrapped in oilskin packages in a Midlands salesroom. It probably didn't occur to him that anybody would believe this story, but thousands of aficionados of Victorian literature apparently did, especially in America, where the book went down a storm. The New York Times reported that of 34 reviews of the first Flashman novel, "10 had treated the book as genuine historical autobiography".</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Flashman was back with a bang. But who was he? Harry had grown up handsome, smart and raffish but reassuringly devoid of redeeming qualities. We learn that his grandfather made a pile of money from rum and slaves and "probably piracy" in the Americas; that his father was a dissolute former MP, living beyond the bounds of respectable society, and that his mother, born of the self-promoting Paget family, had apparently instilled in him the advantages of cowardice and passing himself off as a member of the aristocracy.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Thus equipped, and having chosen the Army as a career, Harry went unpromisingly forth into the world - only to find that the world loved him. "I think people respond well to a character like Flashman because he's absolutely everything you're not supposed to be," says David Tibbets, founder of the Denbigh-based Flashman Society. "He's selfish and greedy and completely politically incorrect, and treats everyone he meets, especially women, dreadfully. There's a wonderful bit in Flashman at the Charge, where he is being pursued across the snow by Cossacks, and to lighten the load he throws his mistress off the sledge.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"People like a rotter. Even in the original story, Flashman's the most interesting character. Tom Brown's a bore, a real goodie-goodie, and the best bits are where Flashman beats him up."</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">By his own account, Harry is an imposing man, six-foot two and 13 stone, with broad shoulders - unburdened by any weight of conscience - and long legs, perfectly fashioned for running away at the first hint of danger. His complexion is swarthy enough for him to pass as a Pathan tribesman during his adventures in Afghanistan, and his talent for languages enables him to lie and smarm his way through life in an impressive variety of tongues. He turns every disaster to his advantage and ends up with a knighthood and a VC.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Yet it is as a seducer that Harry truly shines. The number of his conquests is given in one book as 478, though this calculation occurs only halfway through the 12-volume oeuvre, when our hero is still developing his chat-up lines. "I know women, you see," he remarks. "?One of the things that has always enchanted me about African women with an appetite is that they don't waste any time before indulging it."</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">He brazenly steals the mistress of Count Otto von Bismarck, Germany's Iron Chancellor, with severe repercussions for Europe; and joins the queen of Madagascar in her royal bath: "she swam and played about in the water in a most provoking way, teasing and rubbing noses and kissing - but never a smile or a word or the least softening of those basilisk eyes - and then, suddenly, she clapped her legs around me and we were way, rolling and plunging like d----ation, one moment on the surface and the next three feet under. She must have had lungs like bellows, for she could stay under an agonising time, working away like a lecherous porpoise."</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Not that Flashers is exactly a free man. During an early regimental posting in Scotland he caddishly deflowered Elspeth Morrison, daughter of a sternly moral family which had given him hospitality, and was forced into a shotgun marriage. Elspeth remains devoted, if not entirely faithful, to him.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Ever since Harry's re-emergence in 1969, critics have been debating not only his merits as a literary figure but his anti-heroical meaning. Many - most of them on the Left - have tried, desperately, to portray him as a parody of all that was cruel, exploitative and immoral about the Empire and the central Victorian code of duty to Queen and Country. According to this analysis, he offers nothing to laugh at and still less to admire, and if there is any excuse for his deplorable conduct it is to be found in his unhappy boyhood in the freezing corridors of his public school.</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It is doubtful that Flashman would see it that way. The joyousness of his roguery is too vivid to be social commentary. Certainly, Fraser showed no signs of disapproval. The precise opposite of his flamboyant character in many ways, Fraser - a quiet, thoughtful man, happily married for 60 years - saw the Empire as one of the great civilising forces of history, and regretted only that modern Britain retained so little pride in it. "Nowadays the view of the British Empire is that it was a bad thing about which we should feel guilty," he once said. "I can't subscribe to that. I think it was one of the best things that ever happened to mankind."</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Born in 1925, he had grown up on "tuppenny bloods" - the children's comics that robustly extolled the valour of men and war - and with the notion of British imperial power as something noble and imperishable. "The map was pink," he recalled, "Britannia ruled the waves and that was that, very satisfactory. The majority were very content with the Empire, and thought it a hell of shame when it came to an end."</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Flashman, for all his imperfections, appears to have represented in Fraser's mind, as he has for many readers, a yearning for a time before the rise of the liberal hegemony, nanny statedom and political correctness, which the author described as "a damnable and dangerous thing".</span>
</p>
<p class="story2">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">What the country really needed, Fraser concluded, was more Flashmans and fewer politicians. It's a tall order. In the 19th century they merely threw him out of school. Today he'd be thrown in jail.</span>

</span><span class="x-nc-sel5"><span class="x-nc-sel5">I live in the US, but have religiously read all of the Flashman books since first discovering them back when I worked in the North Sea in the '70s.  I am sorry to hear of the passing of Mr. Fraser in particular because we can no longer look forward to his biting analysis of the "true" facts behind many of the major episodes during Britain's imperial days.</span></span><span class="x-nc-sel5">

</span><span class="x-nc-sel5"><br></span><span class="x-nc-sel5">
</span><span class="x-nc-sel5"><span class="x-nc-sel5">Because, although I truly enjoyed Flahsman's rollicking exploits - they made for a rattling good yarn, it was his criticisms of the leading lights of the times that I found most entertaining.</span></span><span class="x-nc-sel5">

</span><span class="x-nc-sel5"><br></span><span class="x-nc-sel5">
</span><span class="x-nc-sel5"><span class="x-nc-sel5">Whether it was the Charge of the Light Brigade (one of the most foolish exploits of the Empire), or the ignominious Retreat from Kabul, or the theft of the Koh-i-nohr from India, Mr. Fraser's acid critique of Britain's political and military leaders were hilarious.</span></span><span class="x-nc-sel5">

</span><span class="x-nc-sel5"><span class="x-nc-sel5">It is, however, true, that caddishness such as that displayed by Flashman, awakens a certain yearning in all of us as we watch his career successes from sheer affrontery (and also with the ladies).  In modern times, I have worked with the military in many areas where we were essentially an occupying force (Somalia, Haiti, Lebanon, Iraq, etc.) and I can tell you there are still many Flashmans around in this day and age.</span></span><span class="x-nc-sel5">

I've travelled the last 40 years from central Africa via Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Solomon Islands to Yemen and on with phrases such as 'when are you coming back?'
