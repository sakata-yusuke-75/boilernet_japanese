<span class="x-nc-sel2">MIAMI (AFP) ? Pat Riley is looking at not returning as coach of the National Basketball Association's Miami Heat, telling the South Florida Sun-Sentinel he is leaning toward focusing more on his role as team president.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Riley guided the heat to the NBA crown in 2006 but the Heat, with center Shaquille O'Neal injured, have struggled to an 8-27 record, second-worst in the league. They might be looking for a new coach after this season as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"Sometimes, just with me, I feel like now, more than ever, I might be budding heads with both jobs and I've revisited that over and over again," Riley told the newspaper.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The newspaper reported that Riley, 62, has spoken of selecting a replacement from his staff off assistants with Erik Spoelstra, 37, considered a front-runner.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Riley has a career coaching record of 1,203-654 in 24 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Miami, where he is 447-355 in 11 seasons.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Riley, the NBA's third most successful coach, said in August he would guide the Heat for three more years. But the shocking fall of the club this year and injuries to key players have taken a toll.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Heat have lost eight games in a row, including a 101-91 defeat Tuesday at the hands of Minnesota, the only NBA club with a record worse than Miami.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Riley miss 22 games last season for hip and knee surgery. He also left the team in 2003 just before the start of the season, saying he needed a break and putting assistant Stan Van Gundy in charge.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Riley plugged himself back into the coaching job in 2005 and guided the Heat to a championship that season, his fifth NBA title after leading the Los Angeles Lakers to four in the 1980s.</span>
