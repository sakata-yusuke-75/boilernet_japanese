<span class="x-nc-sel3">By Antony Bruno</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">DENVER (Billboard) - There is a reason people still buy CDs  more than they do digital albums. Actually there are several,  but viruses that come along with music via peer-to-peer sites  (P2P) and a concern over digital rights management (DRM) aren't  the only culprits.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Digital music files just don't provide the same amount of  content that a CD package does. That includes liner notes,  extended album art and lyrics. Buy a digital album today and  all you get are a list of tracks and (maybe) a thumbnail image  of the album cover that you can't even read.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It's one of the reasons music fans still turn to P2P  networks for their music. In addition to providing music free  of charge and free of DRM, P2P sites in many cases also include  digital copies of such extras typically found in the CD.  According to label sources and pirate network tracking firms,  fans downloading full albums from BitTorrent sites almost  universally choose files that include scans of the CD booklet  over those that don't.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Of course, there is little that can be done with those  scans other than view them on a computer. Imagine if the music  industry and the digital music services got together and  offered an official way to access the same content, but make it  available on portable devices as well as make it interactive.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">There are two ways to accomplish this. One is working  directly with a digital music service and hardware developer to  ensure all this new content has an outlet. The other is to go  it alone.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">For the former, iTunes is the most likely candidate.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Although hardly life-threatening, iTunes is facing new  competition from Amazon and a variety of social networking  sites. While it has made great advancements with the iPod,  iTunes' innovation has been slow. The service looks and  operates much like it always has. The only new features are in  video.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">In 2008, look for Apple to make nice with its label  partners by offering a bit more with each download, such as  lyrics and more interactive album art.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">iTunes is the only music service that has a built-in video  download feature. The others offer only streaming video. It's  also one of the few services that feature a tightly integrated  device -- the iPod. Apple is in a great position to roll out  new features across its online store and its devices at the  same time.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Microsoft's Zune is another place to watch for this, for  the same reasons. It also has the integrated service and  device, as well as ownership of the technical building blocks  needed (such as Windows Media Player). And since it's still  lagging far behind Apple in the digital music game, Microsoft  could easily tap digital extras as a battleground for new  market share.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The problem is that the four major music companies rarely  work together on anything. So another angle would be for each  to go it alone. If digital music services can't or won't  incorporate better metadata into their downloaded files, look  for third-party applications to emerge that will do so after  the fact.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Early examples of this are two games developed for the iPod  -- "Musicka," created by the developers of the original music  rhythm game "PaRappa the Rapper," and "Phase," created by "Rock  Band" and original "Guitar Hero" developer Harmonix. Both are  rhythm-based games that let users "play" along to the songs on  their device by pressing buttons at the right time.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The point is that if these game companies can do it, there  is no reason why labels can't offer (or commission) their own  iPod plug-in that will import better album art, liner notes and  lyrics directly from the label or artist and ported into iTunes  and the iPod.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">In the year ahead, look for several efforts from both camps  as digital music distribution becomes more important to the  music industry as well as a point of increasing competition  among service providers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Here are a few areas to watch:</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">ALBUM ART</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">As music formats have changed through the years, album  artwork has suffered. It has gone from sprawling center spreads  adorning vinyl LPs to stamp-sized thumbnails accompanying MP3  files. But as digital becomes the predominant format, look for  album art to evolve.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The early groundwork for this already has been laid. Last  spring, Warner Music Group (WMG) added interactive booklets  based on Apple's Quicktime software to about 75 albums sold on  iTunes, providing photos and links to more multimedia content.  The problem was it was also based on Flash technology, which  the latest version of Quicktime disabled due to a security  flaw.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">There is additional activity on the mobile front. All  labels are working with phone manufacturers on the "mobile  album" concept -- a bundled digital package that includes the  full song, ringtone, wallpaper image and other assets for one  price.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">LYRICS</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">While a lyrics page is quite commonplace in the pages of a  CD booklet, they are nonexistent with digital music files. In  fact, most digital music services only let users search for  songs by artist, track or album name. None have an integrated  lyrics search tool, and you certainly can't download lyrics to  your iPod or other device.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Slowly, things are changing. Yahoo Music last year launched  the first publisher-authorized online lyrics search page thanks  to Gracenote, which has taken on the task of untangling the  Gordian knot of music lyrics publishing rights for service  providers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">That search page isn't integrated with the Yahoo Music  Unlimited service, though. What's lacking is an affordable way  to attach those lyrics to the digital file of the song they  belong to. Digital music services would have to pay an extra  fee per download to offer that capability, and devices would  have to add a new "lyrics" tab or some other functionality for  users to subsequently access the words while the song plays.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Look for Gracenote and its service provider partners to  develop exactly that in the year ahead.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">LINER NOTES</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Perhaps the most fundamental changes coming to album extras  are in the liner notes. In a CD booklet, it's all well and good  to list a bunch of people to thank and leave it at that. In the  digital age, liner notes become far more interesting.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Rather than thanking so-and-so producer for doing such a  great mixing job or their family for support, digital albums  can provide behind-the-scenes footage of the producer and band  at work, or perhaps a "making of" featurette, interview Q&amp;A,  family photos/video, etc.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">One area to look for such innovation is with the CDVU+ and  MVI formats created by Walt Disney and WMG, respectively.  Technically these are multimedia CD formats, not digital music  formats. But both represent a step toward expanding the way all  involved view a music product.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Both add what can best be called "digital magazines" to a  CD that, when inserted into a computer, allow fans to access  videos, link to online features, lyrics and more. These  physical products represent the bridge between old-school CDs  and the digital future. As labels focus on selling more digital  albums instead of individual tracks in the new year, expect  them to learn from these experiments and begin creating similar  all-digital packages as well.</span>
