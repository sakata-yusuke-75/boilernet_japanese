           Much of Andrew Piddington?s movie is like that, imagining an interior life for its 25-year-old protagonist, a life is as contradictory and exasperating as it is unknowable. Based in part on Chapman?s prison diaries, the film tracks his activities in the three months leading up to the murder. ?All Chapman?s words are his own,? advises an opening title, though the character quotes liberally, if inaccurately, from movies like

           ("I was searching for some kind of guidance, a mission, and for my sins, I found one"). As the climactic event in Chapman?s story is well known, the film must look beyond plot for interest. To its credit, it doesn?t pretend to tell much more about Chapman than most everyone already knows. Instead, it uses him as the jumping off point for an exploration of celebrity culture, where the focus is not Lennon but the killer?s obsession with renown.

           Fragmented and roiling, Chapman doesn?t provide much in the way of standard biopic fodder. Certainly, he?s sensationally troubled, as the movie indicates right off. Living in Honolulu with his wife Gloria (Mie Omori), he works nights at a tedious security job and nurses a low-level rage at his mother (Krisha Fairchild). Introduced as she?s flirting with a surfer kid younger than Mark, she looks pathetic; watching her from inside his car, he calls her ?a dreamer, moody, right out of

           As the moderately famous Chapman lore has it, he read and reread Salinger?s novel, identifying with Holden Caulfield, sharing his loathing for ?phonies.? As he voices his new self-image, the film illustrates, blandly: as he walks the streets in slow motion, the soundtrack overlaps thunder, music, and dialogue, Chapman?s confusion made clichéd, if not exactly confusing. Though he has flashbacks to the happier moments when he proposes to Gloria, in an effort to possess her and so, save her from the tawdry relationships he imagines she shares with coworkers.

           Here the movie suggests that Chapman?s fears were of the most predictable sort?his jealousy, perversion, and efforts to control his experience (and Gloria?s) all a matter of his choice. Her part in his story is not the film?s concern, though she seems an ironic counterweight to the movie?s vision of Yoko Ono, also slight, obscured in shadow, and dark-haired, an inspiration and anchor for her husband. That Chapman recedes from Gloria even after he declares her love has ?saved? him seems evidence of his insanity (the New York cops called him a ?wacko? repeatedly), at least according to

           . Connecting celebrity and betrayal not only in Chapman?s seeming mind, but also in its own structure, the film examines the interdependence of delusion and desire. It doesn?t much consider what Lennon means, how his assassination closed the ?70s or inaugurated the ?80s, or even how the media shaped that dire time. While the policemen watching over him also watch TV, Chapman describes his state of mind at the time of the shooting as if he?s been flattened: ?There was no emotion in my blood, there was no anger, nothing. There was dead silence in my brain, dead cold quiet.? The movie argues against this emptiness on a larger scale by tracing the unsettling echoes among Chapman, Lee Harvey Oswald, Captain Willard, Travis Bickle, and John Hinckley, Jr. (not to mention the complete and apparently legal ease with which guns are purchased and transported in America). ?I was Mr. Nobody,? Chapman says, ?Till I killed the biggest somebody on earth.?

           But in this ambition, Chapman is neither singular nor deviant. Rather, he is a logical product of his moment. More tragically, he?s a projection, a look forward into the future of celebrity culture, our own present, when the destruction of stars has become business as usual.
