        Now granted, things aren't really rough yet.  But it's getting there, and fast.  The bulk of the buzz and political coverage is around assorted TV ads so this long post is heavy on them. Accordingly, here are the most significant developments shaping the race for the next week leading up to the Iowa caucuses:

      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
        After a couple weeks of not fighting back against the sea of attacks from fellow candidates and heightened scrutiny from the press, he emerged out of the brief Christmas respite to air his same old, "vote for me because I'm a Christian" ad:
       </span>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
        The ad was indeed a great mass media introduction of Mike Huckabee to the Evangelical-heavy Iowa caucus-goer demographic.  Emphasis on

       <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">

       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
        But then just yesterday, Huckabee's campaign unleashed two different ads to augment his rotation.  The first is an obvious effort to just play "Mr. Nice," don't talk about the multitude of issues being brought to bear against him, and essentially run out the clock asking the overly nice Iowans to vote for his overly nice personage:
       </span>
      </p>

       <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
        The 2nd ad is more bizarre:

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
        The spot is clearly designed to respond to the hits Huckabee has been taking on taxes and crime, but the response - primarily via on-screen messaging - is overshadowed by the "Founding Fathers" dialogue from the candidate, which makes little sense in the context of the current campaign dialogue.  More importantly, if a candidate is going to respond to attacks against him he should either a) have a very solid, direct comeback on the topic at hand or b) punch back hard on a different subject to change the conversation.  Huckabee is doing neither.

Forget the specific numbers (which are devilishly difficult to predict anyway), three regular pollsters showing the same trend is the story [

        since this post was originally composed, two more polls from Zogby and Maxon Dixon have been added to the RealClearPolitics link above, supporting the same trend.  Of course, now we enter the closing days where last minute voter shifts can be volatile so take it all with a grain of salt].

      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
        The race is tightening in part due to Huckabee's oblique strategy discussed above, a steady spat of negative and/or mixed media stories, the Club for Growth's continued hits on taxes, and a steady stream of "contrast" ads from Mitt Romney.  Here's the latest:

        The astute reader will recognize that such "contrast" ads are pretty tame stuff in the world of politics, but this is Iowa, famous for its dislike of negative campaigns.  Note, for example, the negative information on Huckabee is conveyed by a soft, gentle female voice.  Either way, no candidate can hold their ground in the face of a well-funded onslaught without responding in some way.  Huckabee isn't quite doing that.  But...

Now the candidate has to stop hurting himself.

        The ad is interesting on a several levels.  One, McCain calling Romney a phony is like Romney calling McCain a prick.  Both charges can be substantiated, at least enough for a campaign ad.  But it's over the top given the current tone of the campaign debate.  Second,

        by Romney; probably because his campaign knows they don't have a good comeback on the merits.  Third, the sourcing and content of the ad feed into a theme McCain's campaign is pushing, either on purpose or inadvertently:  "the media loves me."  McCain's other current New Hampshire ad reeks of it:

        Pimping a candidate's newspaper endorsements to the campaign's advantage is of course a time-honored tradition.

        With Huckabee's continued stumbles in recent weeks, it increasingly looks like the winner of New Hampshire will be the favorite to win the nomination against Huckabee and his core of Evangelical voters into which he seems to be sequestering himself.  It won't be guaranteed, but the winner of New Hampshire probably wins Michigan too.  That's a whole lot of mo' heading into South Carolina, Florida, and beyond.

           In any case, he is definitely a factor in the race, and should be a part of any article that seeks to understand the race's dynamics.  But Eric ignores him.  Strange.

         My thought is Eric genuinely just does not think that Pauls votes, supporters, bumperstickers, signs, straw poll wins, blimps, volunteers in Iowa and NH (and every other state), etc... will just not translate into votes.  I do not think he is like some of the elite media such as Fox News who know how well he is doing and is trying to exclude him because of fear rather than ignorance.

         It is true that Dr Pauls campaign has not hit #1 in any of the 'scientific polls' but as you also point out, times have changed.  Pauls campaign is different from others but only in that new technology has matured enough to allow a traditional grassroots campaign to compete with a corporate media campaign.  Grassroots campaigns are not new.  It is the technology that is new.

           But as technology has allowed polls to progress, scientific polls have not.  THey are still conducted on landlines and are thus becoming obsolete.  There is much speculation that Pauls supporters are much less likely to have a landline than other candidates supporters.

           There is also bias in the scientific polls created when they decide who to poll.  Often their definition of a 'likely republican voter' is 'voted in the 2004 republican primary'  But ask yourself who voted in the 2004 republican primary and compare that with who we expect to show up this year and you will see there is a big disconnect.

           But I would also argue that even without the changes in technology, the polls have traditionally been worthless in predicting the winners of races.  Kerry had 5% up till mid december in 04.  Clinton was something similar in 1992.  Bush lost Iowa and NH if I remember correcting in 2000.  What does this mean?  It means polls give the media things to talk about but even the most meaningful polls (NH and IA primaries) are not the be all end all of who will come out on top.

           The cell phone issue is a valid one.  Youths are increasingly converting to not using landlines, and this is not taken into account in telephone surveys.  But with Paul's polling numbers, there would have to be:

           I doubt the stars will align that favorably for Congressman Paul.  It is not that it is impossible, but the predictions people like Mr. Guthrie are making require a suspension of belief and a belief in the power of the Cause.  That makes for good newsletter fodder, but I don't think it's a sound political prediction.

           The "likely Republican" issue is an interesting factor too.  We'll see, on that.  Some polling companies determine "likely voters" by asking about past participation and a few other questions.  Others just outright ask if the voter is likely to participate.  Since I haven't seen Paul performing incredibly strongly in the latter, I'll assume that this is another probable non-poll breaking issue.

           Certainly, the political climate is a dynamic one and you are right that fortunes can change.  But Congressman Paul's negatives are the highest of any candidate, among General and Primary voters.  He has "will not considers" near 50 percent.  There is a similar strand among all the candidates you mentioned, and it's that their "will not considers" were never that high.

           a while back.  I'll try to dig it up next time I have access to a university database.  It's a very strong case for this being an issue that pollsters need to address, but not yet one that affects the outcomes of polls heavily - yet.

           The thing that surprises me most in all of this is the Giuliani slide.  Caucuses are generally dominated by extremists, real political junkies.  In republican circles that frequently translate to religious/true-believer activists.  Hence WA's caucuses nominating Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson a few cycles back.  Sure a low point in a state's political history filled with low points.  A Huck surge is no surprise.  I would have expected Edwards to do better.  Giuliani never had much of a chance in IA.  But Rudy's big drop nationally is more of a surprise.  I felt like it started when he and Mitt got into that squabble over Mitt's yard company hiring illegals.  Rudy looked really punk on that one.  I wonder if that one faux pas started a chain reaction?

           Also interesting is the heat on the Dem side of the aisle.  They are getting more, bigger contributions than the GOP.  More celebrities on the stump (the Chuck-strich not withstanding http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzhfkJHq7SY ).  So many of the pundits have asserted that the dems have the fire this year, which will lead to their inevitable victory.

           But I am not convinced of that logic.  It's not that all of the GOP candidates are more flawed for the GOP base than the Dem candidates, I think it is that the GOP has such a STRONG field that the GOP base will be pretty happy with ANY of the top tier candidates.  Look for the GOP base to get REALLY fired up AFTER each side has their candidate.  I suspect that the Dems are hitting to hard now, and may punch themselves out for the general.  We can but hope.

         Don't you get a sick feeling in your stomach when Romney pulls out all that dough and uses it on attack ads against all the other candidates?  Huckabee sticking up for McCain is a sign of things to come.  Romney will now have to stop the attack ads and switch to more personal biographical stuff.  If he doesn't do it, McCain and Huckabee form a temp partnership, Romney sinks in Iowa, McCain takes NH and Rudy is free to compete in Florida and super Tuesday.

         The assumption that the winner of New Hampshire then beats Huckabee for the nomination ignores that Giuliani is still in the race at least through Florida. If Rudy wins there, he probably will win more delegates on February 5th than anyone else since he has large leads in NY, NJ, and significant leads in California, Illinois and others.

           The current notion that the candidate who continues to lead in the Real Clear Politics Average of polls is a dead duck and not worth mentioning is remarkable. A lot of people are not even focused on word wars between Huck, Mitt, and John. They do however remember who cleaned up NY, was named Times Man of the Year and lead a lot better response to 9/11 than we see in response to other catastrophic events such as Katrina and the Bhutto assasination

         A few months ago some of the Paulites took a political test on another website to see who they were closest to politically.  After Paul it was three democrats - their least closest clones were Republicans.  Obama and Clinton in that order, that is who the Paulites are closest to politically when considering all of their positions based on what they consider most important.

         (and elsewhere on SoundPolitics and other blogs), some libertarians and some Ron Paul supporters refer to President Lincoln as a tyrant and voice strong opposition to the Lincoln's war policy, his governmental philosophy, and his actions to defeat the pro-slavery secessionists in the Civil War.

           In my opinion, we have seen true tyranny in the 20th and 21st centuries - in Nazism, Japanese Imperialism, the evil Soviet empire, and in today's Islamic fascism (which I consider the focus of evil in the modern world.)

           Although the Soviet Union fell apart, and although many Eastern European countries and former Soviet Republics have overturned communism, we see tyranny today in Iran, North Korea, and elsewhere - including in the western hemisphere (witness Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Fidel Castro in Cuba).

           While it is hyperbole of the most extreme sort to call Lincoln a tyrant, Chavez and Castro are real, living tyrants, posing a serious foreign policy threat for America.  The question of how to deal with Cuba and Venezuela came up in the December 9 GOP presidential debate in Miami.

           In the course of the debate, Ron Paul was questioned directly about U.S. policy toward Latin America, and discussed the twin advocates of socialist tyranny in his remarks.

           Two excerpts from the transcript are posted below to show Paul's comments and the audience reaction.  Based on just the transcript, the reaction of the audience was mixed - booing and applause.  Many in the audience evidently knew first hand, or at least from the experience of their families, of the actual tyranny existing today in communist Cuba.  You can't tell from the transcript whether the booing or applause predominated.  However, by going to the

           Just so you know, saying there are only a few people supporting Paul is about 5 tactics old.  The rest of the public has moved past it and on to laughing at him, ridiculing him, calling him racist, calling him a hypocrit, trying to pretend he is dishonest, and lastly ignoring him again after non of the other methods worked.

         First off to Eric:  I usually find you opinions very fair, but your Romney bias shows through.  You don't bother to point out that Romney's ad against McCain in NH is patently false.  McCain never supported Amnesty as Romney states in the Ad (this is a common misconception, especially with Romney defining Amnesty however he wants to -- someone needs to call him on this).  Second, Romney himself supported the immigration plan as defined by McCain, before he saw that it would cost him election points, at which point he flip-flopped on the issue.  Romney has a history of flip-flops and he wonders why the Concord newspaper calls him a phony.  He is a phony.  He makes Kerry look like a choir boy when it comes to flip-flops.

           Now to Bruce:  I find it hard to believe that RP will finish 2nd in Iowa.  Isn't that quite the stretch.  Having money is one thing, but having organization is another.  Romney is credited with having the most eleborate Iowa organization with purchasing district organizors to make sure his voters get out.  Too bad he is spending money on TV Ads, he could be wiser to use it to fund people getting to the caucuses.  Hillary is purchasing shovels for people who may get snowed in, and also working with grocery stores to make up sandwiches for the caucuses to make them more a social event that the small-town folk will come out to.  Huckabee's strength is strong with the home-school crowd and pastor network.  I see the rest of the candidates vying for third, which most likely will be Fred Thompson.

           Now in New Hampshire, I am also unsure where you think RP will make it any higher than third.  Romney has the core Republican base.  McCain will sow up the anti-Romney Republican crowd and the Republican leaning Independents.  The Anti-war independents will most likely vote for Obama in the Democratic Primary, since it will also be a three way fight.  Ron Paul's core of libertarian leaning Republicans isn't big enough to carry him any higher than third and will be torn between Romney and Ron Paul.  If Romney wins Iowa, then they will lean Romney (get behind a winner).  The only scenario that I see Ron Paul capturing this crowd will be if (1) Huckabee wins Iowa, and (2) Ron Paul actually uses some of the money he has and purchases massive media advertising this week.  He can't wait until Iowa and he can't afford to sit on the money.  NH is do or die for Ron Paul.  If he doesn't come in third, he may have the money to compete, but will be shut out of the free media air time.

           One other tidbit, the other day, I see where Ron Paul did agree with Huckabee when asked about evolution.  Ron Paul doesn't agree that evolution is a given fact.  It is a scientific theory, but has a lot of holes that have yet to be proven.  If anyone looked at it independently they would see that its adherents show the same level of faith that comes with religion and not the level of scrutiny and reserved judgement that comes with science.  They want to believe that evolution is fact because they fear the opposite.  They have blinders on when judging the actual facts and are willing to make jumps in logic/theory to fill in the blanks that can only be equated to a leap of faith.

           Finally, if Ron Paul is for small or minimal government, why did he submit items for earmark funding?  McCain didn't submit any earmarks and has been fighting government spending for years.

         I am very sad that Newt Gingrich is not "electable".  I think he is the only real "heir of Reagan" out there, and would make a much better President than any of the current candidates.

           a. Paul's support comes from a collection of really odd bedfellows. First there are the young disaffected like you who respond to a libertarian message, then there are the hate groups like the Nazis, Aryan Nation, and KKK, and probably one of the most successful astroturf campaigns in history run by Soros, Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance operatives because their real goal is to elect Hillary. They want either Paul as the republican nominee or a third party. The only way Hillary can be elected because of her negatives is to have a large number of votes siphoned from republicans.

           As it is, I'm quite concerned about our candidates come caucus time here.  I will be attending the caucus specifically to keep Ron Paul supporters from taking over.  When I take a look around and consider support for Huckabee, Rudy, and McCain, I might have to do something I said I would never do, vote for McCain.  If that is what it'll take at the county caucus to keep Paul from winning, I would - hopefully it doesn't come to that.  But with Romney's attack on McCain in NH, it sure makes me feel at least a tiny bit more fondly of that turncoat.

           To be fair, I've put up everyone's recent ads so viewers have a chance to judge the content for themselves.  As to your point about "amnesty," I think the immigration debate has been so hashed and re-hashed that I hardly need to add commentary on that specific issue.

           Lastly, Romney never "supported" any of McCain's immigration legislation.  The supposed sourcing for that is a November 2005 interview with the Boston Globe where Romney said some aspects of a proposal by Senator McCain and Senator Cornyn  were "reasonable."  You'll note that Senator Cornyn was opposed the actual immigration legislation that McCain tried to push this past year.  To construe Romney's comments on that bill two years ago into today's debate, let alone turning them into something they weren't, is a total misnomer.

           The money is coming from not just a few groups as you are suggesting.  Paul has kept his financials more transparent than any other candidate by posting real time donation information.  His donations are coming from hundreds of thousands of individuals.  Yes a couple have been identified as coming from some racist organization.

           His support is not coming from the left by people you think really just want Hillary to Win.  Ron Paul would be a nightmare for Hillary.  He would tear her anti war agenda apart for what it really is leaving her with a few die hard hillarycare supporters left supporting her.  Any other GOP candidate will be easy for her to defeat because all she will have to do is say she is antiwar and she will have a good 55% plus of the population on her side with that statement alone.

           Turn to late 2007 and early 2008. In the early stages of the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, the leading (and even the non-leading) candidates tried to trump each other's antiwar credentials.

           Especially since encouraging progress in the military situation and the backfiring of the ultraleft Moveon.org attack on General Petraeus, the Democrats (especially Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) have started to verbally distance themselves from timelines and funding cutoffs.

           In fact, just as Kerry in 2004 at the Boston Demcoratic convention sought to portray himself as a military hero who would do a better job of fighting and killing the terrorists, we can expect the 2008 Democratic nominee to similarly claim they would not retreat, not surrender, not cut off funds, etc.

           The Democrats have already begun to slightly distance themselves, and as November 2008 approaches, they will continue to incrementally distance themselves from the far left. The better to get elected, you see.

           Some Democrats, some liberals, and some antiwar activists falsely claim that the 2006 elections represent a "mandate" to "end" the war. However, if it were really true that the American people agreed with retreat from Iraq, there would be no brake stopping the Democratic candidates from pursuing their misguided, but sincere, "exit strategy." (Besides, even retreat from Iraq would not "end" the Islamic fascist war against us.)

           As in 2004, they will fail, I believe. But in order to make sure that their disingenuous effort fails, Republicans and convservatives and others who support victory must hold the Democrats' feet to the fire. We must constantly point out that the Democrats' sincere desire and sincere goal is to force retreat from Iraq, and to go back on the defensive with regard to the threat of Islamic terrorism.

           I suppose your McCain Comments are valid.  My question would be though... how were they treated by the GOP when back in 2000?  Had they been treated better would they have been more loyal?

           As for Pauls campaign... you are right... I will have a hard time voting for a different GOP canidate if Paul does not get the nomination.  However President is but just one small part of the party.  Local political leaders should use these campaigns to bring in supporters, volunteers, and future leaders and candidates for all the local elections that affect the people much more.  Paul supporters on a local level want to reduce government power in olympia, bring school choice to everyone not just the rich, reduce/elliminate taxes, elliminate government monopolies such as the ferry system and liquor control board, etc... These are all things the local GOP leaders should be jumping head over heals to get supporters and PCOs for.  But instead some (not pudge) are screening them out all becuase of just one election.

           The man himself refuses to rule it out...which says volumes about him and his intentions: it sure does seem he shares that visceral power hunger with Whoribillary, as opposed to what is best for the country and his "party".

           The fact that he will not rule it out means he is not someone that will willy nilly make absolute claims that so many politicians make.  He made that clear in his meet the press interview that he has NO INTENTIONS of running other than as a republican.

           As for him not being a republican, he has ran as one and won at least 10 times.  That should count for something.  I guess those in brazoria county TX GOP just do not know enough to listen to you when voting in those GOP primaries down there.  Nevermind all of his policies are pretty much the same as what Reagan and even Bush ran on.

           As for him being power hungry... what has attracted many people to his campaign is in fact his aversion to power.  This is a man that has returned part of his congressional office budget each and every year.  A man that is relunctantly running for president only because people kept begging him to do so.  This is a man that wants to reduce the power of the presidency.  This hardly sounds like a power hungry man.

           Ron Paul, although a Republican congressman, refuses to pledge to back the Republican presidential nominee in 2008.  If he himself does not possess even this minimum level of support for the Republican Party, what level of true support can we expect from his followers?

           Ron Paul and the Libertarian Party have no chance to be a significant factor in the 2008 presidential election.  His isolationist, non-interventionist views (for example on Venezuela and Cuba, see my comment #17 in this thread) are rejected overwhelmingly by the American people.

           As anyone who has done extensive doorbelling will tell you, very large numbers of these people are "false positives" - they were liberals and Democrats who deliberately voted for McCain in an effort to thwart Bush, fully intending to vote for Al Gore.  They often respond with hostility to Republican doorbellers.

         Actually Steve... his views on venezuela and cuba are the opposite of isolationism.  He is the only candidate saying that we should talk to and trade with these nations.

           Certainly not all Paul supporters will join the GOP.  Not all of any candidate supporters are 100% behind thier candidates party.  But certainly you must agree that there are many Ron Paul supporters that fit nicely into the GOP if only the leadership of the state/county/LD/Precinct welcome them?

           What some antiwar activists, some liberals, some Democrats, and some others call "engaging our enemies" (whether Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, etc.) is absolutely in contradiction to the Republican and conservative foreign policy in the tradition of Ronald Reagan.

           It is not a good idea (and it is not a Republican or conservative idea either) to treat enemies, dictators, and pro-terrorist regimes "with friendship" as we would treat anybody else.  Ron Paul's comments on Venezuela and Cuba (below) somewhat tend in that direction, don't they?

           Also, it is not a correct analysis (and it is not a Republican or conservative analysis either) to say or imply that America is somewhat responsible for the creation of tyrants like Chavez or Castro.  Ron Paul's comments on Venezuela and Cuba (below) could inadvertently open some confusion on that score, wouldn't you agree?

Actually, I believe we're at a time where we even ought to talk to Cuba and trade and travel to Cuba....  But ... let me tell you why we have a problem in South America and Central America: because we've been involved in their internal affairs for so long. We have been meddling in their business.

           Now as a shop keeper you have no idea which group is which so you have to either be nice to all or suspicious of all.  By being suspicious of all you are going to turn away all the people that came into your store with an open mind (Paul supporters).  This will hurt business which will make your store less attractive to your regular customers.

           So my point is sure you could treat all Paul supporters like they are evil hillary supporters.  The end result will be you hurt the GOP but at least you will have less false positives when you go doorbelling.  Eventually you only have a few doorbells to go to which will make doorbelling easier as well.

           MArzolf seems to have chosen to reduce the number of doorbells in an effort to reduce false positives.  I woudl rather deal with the false positives and grow the party.

           I expect Ron Paul to be on the ballot in the general election, either as an independent or a Libertarian.  It appears to me that almost all Ron Paul supporters share his opposition to traditional Republican and conservative foreign policy.

           I believe virtually all of them will oppose the GOP nominee and vote for Ron Paul in November 2008.  I expect he will get about 1% of the popular vote and zero electoral votes.  We shall see, but that is my prediction.

           Ron Paul himself is setting a very bad example for his supporters by refusing to commit to support the GOP presidential candidate.  I won't support the Republican nominee unless it is me! - that is a really bad example for supposed "new people being brought into the Republican Party."

           That lack of organizational unity is bad enough, but when combined with policies and philosophies that are sharply counterposed to Republican and conservative traditions, it is even worse.

           Historically, yes the GOP primary goal was protectionism and high tarriffs.  In the past 50 years however that has been more of a democrat stance than a republican stance.  America was built on the idea of freedom and free trade.  Telling americans we can not trade with entire nations is not a traditional american view.  It has also been highly ineffective at achieving the goals our previous presidents have hoped such embargos would help.

           If you are not advocating being cruel to Ron Paul supporters, then I suppose we do not disagree.  I am merely advocating that the GOP welcome them as one of their own.  It sounds like you agree with this?

           Since 2000 the GOP has been losing members steadily.  I am curious when the idea of interventionism and nation building became a central platform of the GOP that we are not to question?

           But you are wrong that Ron Paul will run as a Libertarian or an independent.  I wish that if he does not get the R nomination he would do so, but the odds against it are about 1,000 to one.  Ron Paul will run for his TX congressional seat if he does not gain the nomination.

           You do not have to fear that he will split the vote.  What you have to fear is the voters when the R's nominate a pro-war candidate.  If you do, you will lose, just as the pro-war R's lost in 2006.

           As a congressman during Reagan's first term, Ron Paul often criticized the Reagan foreign policy.  Eventually, in 1987 he quit the Republican Party and ran for president on the Libertarian ticket in 1988.

           Some libertarians, in their sharp opposition to the Reagan foreign policy, went so far as to use such words as "foolish," "tragic," "disgrace," and "flawed" in describing Reagan's foreign policy.  Other libertarians accused Reagan of pursuing a policy that was in the interests of "international bankers" and "industrialists."

           I recall that some 1980s opponents (mostly leftists, liberals, and Democrats) of the Reagan administration even accused Reagan of picking a fight with Libya, and of provoking and defying Qaddafi.  Unfortuantely, some 1980s libertarians agreed with them.  It was in this context that Ron Paul left the GOP in 1987 and ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988.

           Again, in order for you to understand more accurately the facts regarding traditonal Republican and conservative Republican foreign policy, I recommend searching the internet for Reagan's speeches and writings on foreign affairs and military policy, as well as such documents as Republican Party platforms and the transcripts of the 1980 Reagan-Carter debates and the 1984 Reagan-Mondale debates.

           As a congressman during Reagan's first term, Ron Paul often criticized the Reagan foreign policy. Eventually, in 1987 he quit the Republican Party and ran for president on the Libertarian ticket in 1988.

           I am not saying that the GOP has always been 100% pro Peace. I am merely stating that the GOP has traditionally been the less willing party to take us to war when compared to the Democrats in the past 100 years.  Bush is the first GOP president from the GOP to take us into a major war.

           Ron Paul, although a Republican congressman, refuses to pledge to back the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. If he himself does not possess even this minimum level of support for the Republican Party, what level of true support can we expect from his followers?

           Steve, you know I have great respect for you and have promoted your candidacy on Life of the Party.  But I need to ask you about this statement.  1) Do you think this justifies any county GOP to turn away Ron Paul supporters?  2) Why would you hold it against someone to not pledge backing of the GOP nominee, regardless of who it is?  I know a huge constituency, a large portion of the pro-life movement, who refuse to back Giuliani if he gets the nomination.  Should these people be excluded from becoming PCO's?  3) As strongly as you feel about the war, would you pledge right now to back Ron Paul if he is the nominee?

           Bush ran against nation building in 2000. Then on September 11, 2001, something happened that has never happened before in the history of this country. You might want to research it. It was really big and it changed everything.

           Bruce, if you believe Paul isn't going to run in the general when he doesn't get the GOP nomination, I got a bridge and some swampland for you. A few months ago, he said he wouldn't. Now he says it's "unlikely". Do you get the subtle difference? He knows he can't win, so he's changing his tune. Ron Paul is a politician. Politicians say one thing and do another. Ron Paul is no different. He is just as power hungry as every other politician in Congress and everywhere else. If he wasn't power hungry, he  would have never run for Congress and he wouldn't be running for President now. Politics is always and only about power.

           You cite the fact that he is running for his congressional seat as evidence he won't run, but remember Leiberman in 2000 when he ran for VP and the Senate in the same election? He covered his bases and there is no reason RP won't do the same.

         You put up ads of other candidates with comment, but with Romney's attack ad on McCain, you did not comment to the truthfulness.  Romney has the credibility problem not the other candidates.  Take a look at this article:

           The local Northeast press know Romney the best.  It is pretty telling when they endorse his opponent over their own.  Romney may have snowed a lot of people, but he isn't snowing me.  I will take straight talk anyday over a politician who will say anything or do anything to win.  We have had eight years of that type of politician.  It is enough.

         Michelle @53 : Good point.  How 'bout it, Steve, will you commit to endorsing Ron Paul if he wins the R nomination?  If you won't then you are taking the same attitude that you are unhappy about my having, and Ron Paul as well.

           Deedub @ 54: Ron Paul has said that the odds are infinitessimal that he will run as an independent or Libertarian for president.  The only reason he will not say 100% "no" is that there is nothing certain in politics.  Something radical would have to change for him to run, and he is admitting that he can not predict this radical change.  But I believe him.  I have seen how hard it is to run a third party campaign, and I've seen how low the vote percentages one gets.

           And I am not happy that Ron Paul won't be running as a Libertarian.  I would love to be able to vote for Ron Paul as a Libertarian.  He's a far better candidate than any the LP has in the pipeline.  Sure, I'll admit that I was wrong if it happens.  But I really don't think it will.  I'll say the odds are less than 100 to one.

           And there was discussion of attacking Iraq within the Bush cabinet BEFORE 9/11.  If this is the case, then what 9/11 changed was not the strategic defense reason for the attacks, but the political opportunity.  After all, we know there were no WMD in Iraq, and Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11 or Osama bin Laden.

           Here is another thing: 9/11 was not such a big change in the world's strategic conditions as you suggest above.  I recall getting an e-mail a while back listing all the Islamic terrorist attacks going back about two decades.  They included the bombing of the US barracks in Lebanon, the attack on the USS Cole, the first WTC bombing in the underground garage, the civilian jet that was destroyed over Lockerbie, Scotland, the cruise ship hijacking...  The point of all these was to lay the blame on other, mostly Democratic Presidents for ignoring the problem of Islamic terrorism, that had clearly been happening for decades.

           Well, you can't have it both ways.  Either 9/11 represented a new strategic situation, or the situation was just the continuation of old conditions.  So, which was it?  I tend to think it was the latter, and that prior administrations' policies had a lot to do with allowing the 9/11 attacks to happen.

         And another thing. You Paulbearers (damn, that's funny!) keep talking about how this election will be won be an anti-war candidate. That's ridiculous! You keep talking about how this war is unpopular. Can you give me one example of a popular war in U.S. history? Of course not. There hasn't been one. If you say World War II was a popular war, you would be wrong. It was opposed by a lot of people who thought we shouldn't get involved. Fortunately, most of the country saw what was at stake and pitched in to win. Not because the war was popular but because they wanted to end it victoriously as soon as possible. Of course, if Ron Paul had been running things then, the Nazis would be running Europe now.

           You guys are totally clueless about the meaning of the polls that show that people don't support this war. Nobody wants our troops over there. If a pollster asked me "Do you want our troops home from Iraq tomorrow?" I would say "Yes." But if that same pollster said "Should the United States of America accept defeat in Iraq so our troops can come home tomorrow?" my answer would be a resounding "Hell, no!!!" We did that once in Viet Nam and our country is still paying a heavy price for it.

           Here's the thing. I'm somewhat ambivalent about whether we should have been in Viet Nam, but to leave on the terms that we did was shameful. We can disagree about whether we should be in Iraq (I believe we are doing the right thing there), but if you believe, as your candidate does, that the U.S. should accept defeat, then you are just as anti-American as he is.

           Okay, okay, I'm going to take some abuse for that one. That's fine. It's like Bill Kristol pointed out the other day, Ron Paul opposes everything this country has done for the past 150 years. How can you get more anti-American than that?

           You have repeatedly stated that if defeated in the GOP primaries your guy would not run in the general. Now even you are hedging your bets. Kinda shows you are not as gullible as I thought and you hope your guy is as dishonest as I think he is.

           As to your 9/11 comments, yes, they discussed attacking Iraq in Bush's cabinet meetings, as I'm sure they did in Clinton's. Both groups probably talked about war with China, too. What's your point? Making contingency plans is part of the job of the people who have sworn an oath to protect us.

           Otherwise, I don't disagree with you much about 9/11 except I think you are missing an important point. What changed was not the danger that the world faced. What changed was the perception that the world was a dangerous place at all. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, we were lulled to sleep that the world was now a safe place and there were no more threats. Well, some of us. I listened to the radio the morning of 9/11 without surprise but with the horrible feeling in my gut that what I knew would eventually happen had finally happened. If perception is everything, then everything changed that day.

           You may be surprised to learn that I hold Reagan just as responsible for 9/11 as Clinton and Bush 41 just as much as Carter. I think the blame can go to every president as far back as Kennedy if you really want to analyse it, with the possible exception of Ford. (He wasn't in there long enough to do much damage.)

           As far as having it both ways, I don't think so. It's not a new strategic situation. The Islamists had declared war on us much earlier and our leaders ignored them. But it wasn't a continuation of the old conditions either because we had a president that actually woke up to the fact that something meaningful had to be done. Without 9/11, I don't believe Bush would have understood it or done anything about it either. Whether you agree with what he's done or not, I don't see how you can deny that he is the first US president who has addressed the problem in any kind of realistic manner. Has he made mistakes? Yup. But he at least takes it seriously, unlike any of the Dems running or your guy.

         Deedub, then we are mostly in agreement on the issue that the only real thing that changed on 9/11 was the people's PERCEPTION of how dangerous the world actually was.  But above, @ 54 you said that 9/11 was really big, and it changed everything.

           And I am not "hedging my bets."  I have always thought that the odds that Ron Paul would run for President as an independent or as a Libertarian were unfortunately, very low.  I still think that today, and that is exactly what Ron Paul has said over and over again.

           I'm not a betting man, so perhaps I misunderstand the term "hedging your bet". All I'm saying is that, like your candidate, you are softening your statment that he will not run if he loses the GOP nomination which he most certainly will.

           As far as your question about 9/11, I stated earlier, if perception is everything (as I believe it is) then everything changed on 9/11. Unfortunately, reality doesn't really matter. Only peoples' perception of reality does. Do you understand that?

             Steve, you know I have great respect for you and have promoted your candidacy on Life of the Party.

             No.  As I said in post #43, there is no reason to be mean or cruel to Ron Paul supporters, or to turn them away.  Ron Paul's campaign, and Ron Paul's policy proposals, should be discussed, debated, and judged on their merits (same as any other candidate).  I am merely pointing out, among other things, that Ron Paul's foreign policy is in stark contrast to Republican and conservative foreign policy in the tradition of Ronald Reagan and Theodore Roosevelt.

             2) Why would you hold it against someone to not pledge backing of the GOP nominee, regardless of who it is? I know a huge constituency, a large portion of the pro-life movement, who refuse to back Giuliani if he gets the nomination. Should these people be excluded from becoming PCO's?

             No loyal and committed Republican Party activist should be excluded from becoming a Republican PCO, regardless of which Republican presidential candidate they support.  We should keep in mind the purpose of the Republican PCO.  They are the representative of the Republican Party in their neighborhood - advocating and doorbelling for Republican candidates and policies, publicizing Republican events, raising money for Republican candidates and Republican organizations, and helping increase Republican voter turnout so that Republican candidates are elected.  These activities are not for everyone, but anyone who is willing to put themselves forward and meet the responsibilities of a PCO, who meets the qualifications of a PCO and goes through the appropriate process to become a PCO should be welcomed.

           I respect the fact that some people, including some Republicans, may want to leave their options open for the general election.  Some may want to campaign actively for an independent, Libertarian, or even a Democratic candidate.  While I respect their right to do so (and in that sense I don't "hold it against them"), I disagree with them.  Also, people who want to keep their options open in this way should consider carefully whether they can faithfully serve as a Republican PCO.  Generally speaking, I'm in favor of giving people the benefit of the doubt, especially if they present themselves as loyal, committed Republicans and in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

           However, I fully expect Ron Paul to be on the ballot in November 2008, either as an independent or on the Libertarian ticket.  Also, Ron Paul himself refuses to commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee.  Given this, it appears that this is the example and model he wishes his supporters to follow.  If Ron Paul himself does not possess even this minimum level of support for the Republican Party, what guidance is he providing his supporters with regard to the level of true support they should provide the Republican Party in the general election?

           Whether or not Ron Paul runs as a Libertarian, both the Democrats and the Libertarians will run antiwar candidates in the general election, while the Republicans will run a pro-victory, pro-national defense candidate in the general election.

           The pro-victory, pro-military Republican candidate will win the election, with their electoral triumph all the larger in proportion to the degree they also run on a platform of fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, and opposition to illegal immigration.

           It is not just about the war against Islamic fascism, but overall foreign policy philosophy.  As I stated in posts #49 and #51, during the Reagan administration, Ron Paul was highly critical of the Reagan foreign policy, including on Grenada, Libya, Cuba, and Nicaragua.  Over his political career, Ron Paul's foreign policy has been sharply counterposed to the Republican and conservative foreign policy in the tradition of Reagan.

           Defeating the Democratic candidate in 2008 (whether Obama, Clinton, Edwards, or somebody else) is important - we need to block their agenda of amnesty for illegal immigrants, government-run health care, tax increases, unrestricted abortion, and defeatism and weakness in the war against Islamic fascism.

           I absolutely pledge right now that I will vote for the Republican presidential candidate in the November 2008 elections.  However, I fully expect Ron Paul to be on the ballot in November 2008, either as an independent or on the Libertarian ticket. Also, Ron Paul himself refuses to commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee. Given this, it appears that this is the example and model he wishes his supporters to follow.

           I don't think I am exaggerating much in saying that this comment generally reflects the position of Ron Paul and many of his supporters.  Of course (although from a different perspective perhaps) some Democrats, some far left activists, some liberals, and some antiwar activists have a similar approach to foreign policy in the post-9/11 era.

           Such myopia, denial, and weakness on foreign policy is nothing new - during his presidency, Reagan received much of the same type of sharp criticism (mostly from the left and the Democrats) on such as issues as Cuba, Libya, Grenada, Nicaragua, and other foreign policy concerns.

           Some libertarians, in their sharp opposition to the Reagan foreign policy, went so far as to use such words as "foolish," "tragic," "disgrace," and "flawed" in describing Reagan's foreign policy. Other libertarians accused Reagan of pursuing a policy that was in the interests of "international bankers" and "industrialists."

           I recall that some 1980s opponents (mostly leftists, liberals, and Democrats) of the Reagan administration even accused Reagan of picking a fight with Libya, and of provoking and defying Qaddafi. Unfortunately, some 1980s libertarians agreed with them. It was in this context that Ron Paul left the GOP in 1987 and ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988.

           We have tried a little of both in the past hundred years.  The path Wilson and T. Roosevelt started us down with the interventionism has led to us getting more and more involved in every skirmish that happens in the world.  The free trade path has led to the greatest economy in the world and closer ties with past enemies to the point where we consider them allies.

         I can't help but notice that with every single article posted on SP, the same three or four Ron Paul supporters chime in and with their long, repititious comments, attempt to suck the air out of the room, so to speak.  If Paul had such a ginormous ground swell of support, you'd think there would be more than just those three or four, wouldn't you?  Go figure!

         Actually, it isn't an two option approach, there are at least four options in dealing with other countries: (1) Free Trade, (2) Restricted Trade (i.e., some Trade Restrictions), (3) No Trade, and (4) Intervention (which has two subcomponents of (a) limited intervention (Bosnia, etc.), or (b) occupied intervention (Iraq)).

           You can't just say Free Trade is a way to go.  We may, as a foriegn policy stance, want to have options 2 or 3.  For example, I view China as falling in category (2) and Cuba as falling in category (3).  Are you stating from your liberaterian position that countries' policies do not matter and we should have free trade irregardless of the countries policies?  That position would seem to me to be a naive and dangerous course that puts morals and countries behaviors behind greed.  I would not wish to take this approach.

           It seems you are agreeing with Paul regarding Cuba.  Dr Paul feels that the no trade with Cuba is a failing policy that should be reversed.

           first of all 9/11 was the work of saudis not iraqis.  Did we invade saudi arabia?  no.  their leader was in afghanistan.  Have we captured him?  No we got close and then turned back and went and attacked Iraq.

           Why Iraq?  Well I am not too sure but I do know that according to people in the Bush administration since day 1, it had nothing to do with 9/11 since pretty much day 1 he was talking about invading iraq.

         No, I don't agree with Free Trade with Cuba, nor with China, and nor with countries that disregard human rights (e.g., Burma, etc.).  I also do not believe in Free Trade with countries that abuse trade policies with us (e.g., charge our goods tariffs, while we allow their goods in w/o tariffs).  You can only have Free Trade if both parties are willing to play by the rules, this includes human rights issues along with economic issues.

           I usually just read the posts, but I will chime in as number 4 or 5 for Ron Paul (using your numbers).  Y'all keep debating Paul's foreign policy/trade stance, but, though very important, it is more important what the future direction of this country will be domestically.

           Ron Paul is the only candidate worth supporting, if you are concerned at all about getting any of your freedoms back.  Maybe you are too young to remember that America was a very free country in it's day (I can only remember to the 1970's, but what a difference!).  With the unconstitutional drug war, SWAT teams in every podunk town that break into houses and kill the wrong people, carrying of "your papers" everywhere you go, the IRS invading all the privacy you have left, "zero tolerance BS", etc. this country is starting to suck.

           We have no where else to go!  (Poeple who love freedom that is).  It's not like we can go to any other country for more freedom, while the socialists can take their pick of dozens of countries with their brand of socialism (they never seem to leave though ??? huh?).

           This is the last resort - there is no more land to the West to get away from the Bull.  It's time to take a stand, and if you don't want that stand to be very violent, we should try to do it in a political manner via Mr. Paul and decent libertarians and conservatives.

         2.  Ron Paul supporters are intolerable. You really are. I want to make this criticism as constructive as possible, but you guys come across as LaRouche or David Koresh type followers. I think if you guys could listen to the way you guys talk about him and toned it down you would be more persuasive.

           I've read posts from Paul supporters calling Abraham Lincoln a "tyrant" and,(at least in my reading of the comments), implying that Lincoln would have been better off to let the southern states secede from the union. It would have been more acceptable, evidently, to have had peaceful free trade with a slave holding Confederacy. I wonder what words the same Paul supporters would use to describe slaveholders. Upholders of states rights, perhaps?

           The logic of Paul supporters escapes me. Are they 1960's flower child holdovers that believe all the world has to do is gather in a big circle,hold hands,chant and everything will be ok?  Or are they Pat Buchanan isolationists?  I think it's more likely that Paul has gathered around him a confused group of people that really aren't sure what they believe.

           It's funny, one of the strongest argument the right has against the left is the left's tendency to make the assertion that all arguments, faiths, and points of view are equal.  They aren't. The Paulzi's embrace this concept.  In post 64 Steve Beren said:

           All candidates are not equal. They don't deserve equal attention.  Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel are not serious players for the Dems.  Alan Keyes is not a serious player for the GOP.  Ron Paul is just another loon.

           If you want to discuss legalizing pot or prostitution, great find a serious person who supports it, not RP.  Pull out of Iraq?  The argument can be made, but RP is not the guy to do it.  He has been relegated to the status of sideshow freak because of his, well, clownish nature.

           I'm a libertarian and a humanist.  I agree with RP on many of the issues.  But the way he phrases the arguments for them is not helpful.  His dancing around with the North American Union conspiracy nuts is just goofy.  What's next, 911 truthers?

           This forum is just too big for people to ignore the RP trolls.  Bruce or travis spouts off, and somebody always takes the bait.  Don't argue with them point by point.  They are true believers.  Unfortunately with moderation that is too light and so many participants it is always just too easy for the RP brigade to suck up all the air out of too many discussions.

           Ok, y'all...I know Ron Paul is like, oh my gosh, the coolest thing since Al Gore invented the internet, but really, ANOTHER comment thread devoted to Ron Paul under a post that didn't mention him (thank you, Eric!)?

           All that aside, I agree with Eric.  It's Iowa or nothing for Romney.  If he gets as much as second place, I think he's pretty dang close to done.  If Huckabee wins Iowa, he could get some much-needed undecideds in later states (Supah Tuesday, anyone?).  I don't think, however, that Huckabee has to, HAS to win Iowa to do well in later states, but it will do a lot to rejuvenate his base and win more caucus-goers later on.

         Cyndi @86: Actually since the threads topic is the GOP presidential primary race, talking about Ron Paul is not hijacking it.  And if you read the comments, it was his detractors that really were the ones that wanted to talk about Ron Paul instead of others.  I just wanted to point out that an analysis of the race without including the top money earner seems incomplete.

           I really think if a serious analysis of paul was put into the original post, there would be alot less reason for Paul supporters to have to mention him in the first place.

           And as helpful advice, if you do not want a certain topic discussed, the best way to handle it is to discuss something different rather than discuss how you do not like the topic that is being discussed.  In otherwords talk about the other candidates if you want to hear others opinions about the other candidates!!!

         Oh no, not "Soylent Green".  In previous threads I and others have opined that Ron Paul supporters are often unhinged, confused, 1960's leftovers.  The prosecution rests...for the time being.

           In the real world, one might figure out that getting more bad/mocking press than good press is a bad thing. Of course those mindlessly optimistic rose-colored glasses wearers will retort that any press is a good thing. All in all, it's hugely entertaining if annoying.

           An illuminating post from Paul supporter and libertarian Bruce Guthrie: "Yes. Lincoln was a tyrant, who killed 600,000 people needlessly, and expanded the power of the federal government just to save his own "legacy." All other nations eliminated slavery without a civil war. We could have done so as well, and we would have had less racism today if we had done so. If the south were independant, we would have strong trade ties with them today. The south would be a bit like another Canada. That would have been just fine. Lincoln violated the spirit of the American Revolution. Sic semper tyrannis."

           Why do you want to talk about the civil war rather than the iraq war?  Wouldn't it be more productive to talk about which candidates supported the war that distracted us from capturing Osama Bin Laden (all GOP candidate but Paul)?

           There is not much Paul supporters or even Paul himself can do about MSM overage of his campaign.  They seem to be pretty dead set against giving much positive coverage.  They like to decide which candidates the masses should support and Paul was not one of the campaigns they chose this year.

           If they chose to mock him, that is their right and one can only hope that the people will see through their smears.  Most here have seen through WVH's so I am guessing the rest of the nation will see through the medias less obvious baseless smears as well.

         Hey Travis, it's your buddy Bruce that wants to discuss the Civil War.  I'll debate you and anyone else about it.  Go back and read the threads and comments. I didn't bring the Civil War  up as you evidently accuse me of doing.

           Ron Paul looks at America the same way. He isn't an optomist.  Ron Paul thinks we are halfway down the shithole.  If we grab on to a nut like Paul he will fulfill his own promise. Maybe he will lead us completely down the shithole. Sorry to be so graphic but I was a young married guy starting out when Carter was President.

           I am not the media nor the left.  I have never based my opposition to the war on the kill rate of our enemy or our soldiers.  My opposition as well as Ron Pauls is based on a principle of non intervention.  That the media and left are silent is their problem.

           What I am curious about is that you want to talk about the civil and leftist abortions rather than the presidential race on hand.  Can we get a little focus?

           I could do better than wikipedia if this was a topic that interested me and was somewhat more contreversial.  I however have never heard anyone disagreeing with the fact that most nations in the western hemisphere and europe have elliminated slavery without a war.

           You in fact still have not disputed it.  Just ridiculed the idea and the sources showing you are wrong.  If you disagree with any of the countries listed on that page and provide a shred of evidence to back your claim up I would be happy to do better than wikipedia.  Until then I am going to focus on the presidential race this thread is supposed to be about but you insist on ignoring.

           Glad you are finally back in the 21st century.  Ron Paul has never claimed that the world will all hold hands in loving peace if we leave Iraq as you suggest.  Instead he argues that the world will continue to have its squabbles and wars and with time we will begin to find ourselves not involved in nearly as many of them.

           Ron Paul is actually an optimist.  He does think that our best days can be ahead of us, but not if we do not cut spending and return to a more humble foriegn policy.

           He was somewhat of a pessimist in running for president.  He did not think would get nearly the support he has recieved.  He thought his message of limited government was no longer popular.  it is true that many americans are scare of such ideas but far more seem to be in favor of returning government back to a constitutional size.  I am one of those that would love to see a much smaller government.  Wouldn't you?

           I don't think your Jimmy Carter analogy works at all.  Paul does think America is half-way down the shitter (or whatever nice way you put it ;-}, but 2 things:

           B) I think Mr. Paul's solution to return to the Constitution (hey, that rhymes, cool) is 180 deg. opposite from Jimmy's socialist idiotic ideas to fix things back in the late 1970's.

           I personally don't believe we should get out of Iraq without finishing the job we started (suprise, huh?), but I don't think we had any business getting involved.  Yes, Saddam Hussein was an evil man and killed and tortured people, what else is new in the world (see N. Korea, the Sudan, pretty much most other countries in Africa, Tibet, etc?

           American soldiers did not sign up to risk getting killed or maimed for some other country's population, only to defend Americans.  I understand neo-cons' "best defense is a good offense" idea, but I don't think it was the correct thing in Iraq.

           And yes, SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE.  That is in reference to my reply to Katomar last night, when I told him I would reveal the nasty secret this year.  The way this country is headed, in 20-30 years, getting to eat died-green mushed-up former Americans will be a treat compared to the rest of life in the Police State of America coming.  ha.

           What in Pauls 20 year history as a congressman leads you to beleive he would increase spending?  What has he said in his campaign that differs from his voting record in congress that would lead you to believe he would raise spending?

           He gets very excited to see it.  He did not think the movement was as far along as it is.  He thought it would be another 20-30 years before so many would be so active and involved to return the federal government back to the size the constitution limits it to.

           1. So, Paul may vote against the final bill, but does he attach the earmarks to bills likely to pass? For example, a bill providing enhancements to military basis which he might vote against because of additional spending, yet it passes by a wide margin and he gets the earmark for his district.

           2. You didn't address the harassment of bloggers and posters by Paul supporters which was also part of Ragnar's post. People are comparing notes and every blogger or poster that I am aware of who puts any information out about Paul is subject to vicious attacks and threats. So far, supporters of no other candidate have acted in such a manner.

           3. On another thread, you lament the fact that the republican leadership doesn't feel that your committment is sufficient to be a PCO. As an observer of Paul tactics, his organization is parasitic and is looking for a host to advance "their" cause, not necessarily that of the host organization. This is what Duke and the KKK did with the republican party in Louisiana.

           My impression of Ron Paul is that he is an unhappy,negative,angry scold. Hardly the sort of individual that I want to see lead the country. Paul comes from the Pat Buchanan school of politics. Let's scare the hell out of everyone. We're all doomed.

         And the subject of Paul voting against his own earmarks is as dishonest as it comes with politicians. He puts the hundreds of millions of dollars of pork for his district in the budgets bills, knowing full well his vote will not prevent it from being passed. Then, he gets to claim some moral high ground while still wallowing in the orgy of money being wasted.

           The left now obsesses about the economy instead.  Where is the same left that accused George W. Bush during the 2000 campaign of "talking down the economy"?  Liberals have been talking down the economy for the past 6-years, with the help of their press lackeys.

         Go to any place you can post comments, especially soundpolitics and look at the number of comments. You can tell which ones have been hijacked by Paulbearers. Most on this site have 10-20 posts, then look at the ones that have 100+ and see if Paul's name comes up.

           I could not agree with you more, Thom. If the Dow is up 200 points AP News always has a "but the housing market is in free-fall" line to contradict it.  The leftist media lives for doom and gloom...until the libs are in power. Then we will see nothing but glowing reports about the economy. A least we conservatives see through this phony garbage. Not that it really helps.

           1. Yes he adds amendments to get earmarks for his district for bills that easily pass.  He also fully discloses all earmarks he proposes.  This does not increase spending, and is not against his statement that he always votes again spending.  I must reiterate again... he always votes against all those bills he adds earmarks to.  I can see why people might think it is hypocrtical.  However I see it more as a service to constituents, returning to them their hard earned money that was taken in high taxes.  They should not be punished simply because they voted for a man that beleive in lower spending while the rest of america votes in big spenders.  It is certainly debateable as to whether it is right or not.  I kinda wish myself that he did not do it, but then again I do not live in his district.

           second, yes there have been reports of threats.  They have been few.  There is really no way to verify that these are truly coming from Paul supporters or from some other person pretending to be.  But regardless of who they are coming from I think they are dispicable.  So does Paul and he has stated that often.  They are however not a reason not to vote for Dr Paul who has above all other canidates been honorable and respectful to all the other candidates, even while they openly laughed at him in debates!  Dr Paul makes it a policy to not attack other candidates and the one time when he did, when he mispoke about the Huckabee ad, he immediately apologized.

           Beyond threats, yes Paul supporters are quick to respond to negative articles about paul in large numbers.  Being a Paul supporter myself, I can tell you it is not a coordinated thing. But I also see nothing wrong with writing to people and giving your opinion.  Do you?

           3. The Paul movement shares nearly 100% of the state GOPs goals.  It would be a good movement to have as a parasite.

           I am not sure if I should respond or not.  You seem to find me intolerable yet you also seem to want me to address comments you made.  I will address them this time but in the future if you find me intolerable please make it crystal clear that you do not want me to reply.

           Anyways the one thing I wanted make certain you understood... Paul is by no means paying people to post on blogs.  It is actually the other way around... the people posting on blogs are paying a relunctant Paul to run for office.

           It is perhaps so amazing to be considered unbelievable, but Paul truly is an honest politician that wants government out of peoples lives.  This has attracted a LARGE grass roots movement, there is no need for him to pay people to post on blogs.  In fact his official campaign has paid for less supporters in Iowa and NH than people that have travelled there from across the country from tehir own money or moeny contributed by other supporters outside the campaign.  Paul also has not paid 1 penny to raise money, it has been done nearly all by unpaid volunteers.  Paul also has had unpaid volunteers outside the official campaign that has wrote letters to fellow citizens in NH and Iowa, called people in those states, raised money for a freakin blimp to fly the eastern seaboard advertising his name, even send DVDs to people.  All by individual citizens outside the campaign.  To suggest that he would need to pay people to post on blogs for him is ludicris when you consider how much more people have done on their own.

           As for being a conservative... Bruce does not suggest he is.  He says he is an independant.  I think I am but if you think I am not because I believe the war is unwinnable... that is fine.  Conservative is just a word.  The thing that is important is we both want less government, not more, if we chose to call each other different things so be it.

           What was our goal in Iraq?  Reduce the number of daily bombings?  If that was our goal, then we should never have invaded.  If it was to reduce the number of terrorists that want to kill us, then I think you should reconsider whether the republicans have a success on their hands.

           I have no objection to debate of issues. For most here, debate is a hobby. Like you, I am not a republican. Most here, who support a candidate, do so with a great deal of committment and spirit. Cyndey supports Huckabee and Eric supports Romney. I know that Huckabee and Romney have been mixing it up in Iowa. I have not read reports of either group of supporters threatening or sleazing the other group. That is not true of Paul supporters. Debate is good, threats and sleeze are not. Everyone knows how to use the Internet, so if you guys want to put out spam on steroids or flood voting sites, oh well. Not that it is going to stop the Paul critics. Just as you are in it for the long haul, so are we.

         I apologize for being snarky. By the sounds of it we share a lot of similar values. My first post about Paul supporters was really meant to try and be helpful. My later one was meant to insult, which is petty. The comment about paying the posters was a joke.

         I think most Paul supporters are probably decent people, but there is a hefty percentaget that are borderline wackos. I am sure each candidate has them, but I think it is undeniable that Paul has a much higher percentage.

         One reason I question the conservative label that Paul supporters claim they are, besides the far left stance on the war and his isolationist foreign policy, is that in Seattle there are probably 10-15 Republicans/conservatives total. Yet, thereare hundreds of Paul signs everywhere. (By the way, none of them have the word Republican on them anywhere). That is why I think a 3rd party Paul run would hurt Dems just as much as Reps.

         We all have our issues with the 2 major parties, but backing a 3rd party is political suicide. It makes your vote meaningless and it also hurts the person you are otherwise closest to politically and helps the person you are least in tune with. I say this as someone who with their first presidential vote, cast that vote for Perot and pretty much helped vote Clinton into office. To this day I haven't been able to wash that shame off. I will never forget that lesson.

         Plus, Ron Paul is just not the right guy. Maybe after this election cycle a few of you will snap out of it and look back and see that too.
